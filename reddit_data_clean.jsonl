You had to acknowledge not running in a sandbox AND allow it to never ask for approvals, which is a bit annoying, but you can just create an alias like **codex-yolo** for it\n\n\\- Claude Code actually had more shots (error feedback/turns) than Codex to get things done\n\n\\- Claude Code still has more useful features, like subagents and hooks. Notifications from Codex are still in a bit of beta\n\n\\- GPT5 in Codex stops less to ask questions than in other AI tools, it's probably because of the released official GPT5 Prompting Guide by OpenAI\n\n  \nWhat is your experience with both tools?","score":100,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n8c82u/codex_cli_vs_claude_code_adding_features_to_a/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n8c82u/codex_cli_vs_claude_code_adding_features_to_a/","author":"marvijo-software","created":1756997266,"numComments":73,"comments":[{"id":"nce1em4","parentId":null,"postId":"1n8c82u","depth":0,"text":"Former Claude Code user for a few months on Max 20x, fairly heavy user too. Loved it at the time, but feels like at least during part of last month the quality of the model responses degraded. I found myself having to regularly steer Claude into not making changes I didn't actually agree on (yes I use the plan mode, it's highly valuable). Claude also often told me that code was production ready when it wasn't, it either failed to compile or had some kind of flaw that needed addressing.\n\nFound out about a $1 Teams plan offer for ChatGPT so figured it would be a great opportunity to check out Codex CLI and GPT\\_5. Suffice to say it impressed me. I tell it what I want, it just does that. Most tasks I've thrown at it are usually completed and successful in one or two shots. If I'm possibly wrong or there's a reason to debate something first then it usually does so, while Claude would've often said \"you're absolutely right, ...\" - blindly agreeing with me regardless. GPT-5 also makes far less assumptions compared to Claude, regularly replying with open questions if it has any. After it completes a task GPT\\_5 will usually follow up with an idea or suggestion related to what we had done, which I also found useful.\n\nThe biggest challenge I've given it so far was to refactor a long overdue and messy .cs file that contained about 3k LOC. I've tried this with various other AI LLMs, including Claude Code (which couldn't read the entire file as it was over 25k tokens), but they just ultimately make bugs and mess things up when trying to do so. I didn't think GPT-5 would be any different, but my god, it surprised me again. I planned with it, did it in small bits and pieces at a time, and a day or so later I'm now down to around 1k LOC for that file. It seems to be working fine too.\n\nI've been using Claude primarily since Sonnet 3.5, and GPT models before Sonnet 3.5, but it looks like I'm back with OpenAI again unless Anthropic \"wow\" me back.\n\nFor Codex CLI, I would recommend checking out the \"just-every/code\" fork. Much nicer UI, /plan, /solve, /code commands, multiple themes, integrated browser capability, can resume previous conversations.","score":30,"author":"Hauven","created":1756999836},{"id":"nceh6vy","parentId":"nce1em4","postId":"1n8c82u","depth":1,"text":"It seems like you are saying you broke the file into pieces and shared it with GPT5.

Tried Cursor CLI with GPT-5 yesterday for code analysis, code reviews and bug hunting. Pretty impressed! GPT-5's analysis actually helped Claude Code solve a couple really tricky problems where I was completely stuck with Opus 4.1.\n\nWas using Gemini CLI with 2.5 Pro before for second opinions. Now, I've asked Opus to compare both tools on the same code reviews and bug analysis tasks. GPT-5 gets 7...10/10, Gemini only 4...7/10.\n\nNow here's where I need help. Are the results I'm getting specific to Cursor CLI or would I get the same quality from GPT-5 through Codex CLI and maybe via claude-code-router + API? I haven't tried Codex CLI before. The whole limits, model version, and context window situation is super confusing. No idea what I'm actually getting with each option.

{"postId":"1o174kr","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Codex CLI + GPT-5-codex still a more effective duo than Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5","selftext":"I have been using Codex for a while (since Sonnet 4 was nerfed), it has so far has been a great experience. And now that Sonnet 4.5 is here. I really wanted to test which model among Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-codex offers more value.\n\nSo, I built an e-com app (I named it vibeshop as it is vibe coded) using both the models using CC and Codex CLI with respective LLMs, also added MCP to the mix for a complete agent coding setup.\n\nI created a monorepo and used various packages to see how well the models could handle context. I built a clothing recommendation engine in TypeScript for a serverless environment to test performance under realistic constraints (I was really hoping that these models would make the architectural decisions on their own, and tell me that this can't be done in a serverless environment because of the computational load). The app takes user preferences, ranks outfits, and generates clean UI layouts for web and mobile.\n\nHere's what I found out.\n\n**Observations on Claude perf**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 started strong. It handled the design beautifully, with pixel-perfect layouts, proper hierarchy, and clear explanations of each step. I could never have done this lol. But as the project grew, it struggled with smaller details, like schema relations and handling HttpOnly tokens mapped to opaque IDs with TTL/cleanup to prevent spoofing or cross-user issues.\n\n**Observations on GPT-5-codex**\n\nGPT-5 Codex, on the other hand, had a better handling of the situation. It maintained context better, refactored safely, and produced working code almost immediately (though it still had some linter errors like unused variables). It understood file dependencies, handled cross-module logic cleanly, and seemed to ‚Äúget‚Äù the project structure better. The only downside was the developer experience of Codex, the docs are still unclear and there is limited control, but the output quality made up for it.\n\nBoth models still produced long-running queries that would be problematic in a serverless setup. It would‚Äôve been nice if they flagged that upfront, but you still see that architectural choices require a human designer to make final calls. By the end, Codex delivered the entire recommendation engine with fewer retries and far fewer context errors.

Switching for good","selftext":"I‚Äôve been grinding with Claude Code for the past 3 days trying to fix what should‚Äôve been a simple logic/math bug, and I‚Äôm honestly done. One example I caught: it literally told me *‚Äúyou have 1000 but you need 100 so it won‚Äôt work‚Äù* basically doing the math wrong and then blaming my code for it.\n\nThat‚Äôs just one example. It‚Äôll add hardcoded logs even though I use dynamic ones, then keep using its own mistake like it never even read the existing code. Instead of fixing the actual bug, it derails into fake logic checks or wrong assumptions.\n\nI‚Äôve been coding for 18 years, I‚Äôm not new to this, and I‚Äôve used Claude Code for about 6 months (really heavy the past 3). In the beginning it was solid, but in the last 1‚Äì2 months the quality has noticeably dropped. These past 3 days were the breaking point. And there‚Äôs zero transparency about limits or why the quality swings. Today I even hit the 5-hour cap on the max plan for the first time, even though I coded less than usual.\n\nI‚Äôd been avoiding Codex because I had some ChatGPT trauma, but my friend kept telling me it‚Äôs way better. So I finally tried it today. Three prompts in, it fixed the exact same logic/math problem Claude had been fumbling for days. Clean, correct, done. Minutes instead of days. It even cleaned up the garbage Claude had left behind. Honestly it felt like using Claude back when it was still good.\n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm done babysitting Claude Code. I‚Äôm asking for a refund and moving to Codex. After testing it today, the difference is insane. My advice to other devs: just try it yourself. I can‚Äôt speak for frontend/design, but if you‚Äôre working on backend or heavy transformer logic, don‚Äôt even bother with Claude it misses so many details it‚Äôs honestly scary. It‚Äôs reset my git, messed with my env, and when you run searches it still uses 2024 data. It used to reach into 2025, so clearly they‚Äôve dialed something back to save compute or whatever. And please, spare me the whole ‚Äòcontext engineering‚Äô garbage, that‚Äôs just fanboy cope. When CC get their s\\*\\* together i will give it another try later as i still like their framework.  /// **UPDATE:** Been using Codex since the switch and so far it‚Äôs been solid  no complaints at all.

I'm still working out the details of exactly how the Claude side of the workflow should function - like how I should use subagents and slash commands. But the overall idea is that you have a conversation with Claude to identify any unspoken assumptions or unclear requirements, then Claude generates prompts. I literally don't talk to Codex at all, I just copy the prompts over and leave it to work on its own. \n\nI think using Codex Cloud rather than the CLI or IDE extension is essential for the way I use it because cloud tasks are built to run without any human intervention, where CLI agent tools are generally built to keep the human in the loop. I've had it literally run a task for 15+ minutes on it's own and when I check the logs it ran into some big problem I would have hated dealing with and Codex just solved the problem itself. And cloud tasks manage their own separate environments so you can run like 2-4+ tasks at the same time if you make sure to ask Claude to specify which tasks are dependent on previous tasks. And when it's done you have it submit a pull request to add the code which helps with observability.\n\nI can't wait for them to add cloud task delegation to the Codex CLI. You can delegate with the IDE extension and the docs say they're adding it to the CLI soon. But right now it's very manual and I have to copy-paste every step. I tried writing a tool to automate pasting the prompt but I got flagged as a bot pretty much instantly. I think it might be possible to delegate with github actions though which could be a good way to automate the workflow. \n\nRight now this is very unexplored territory, at least for me. I've had a project where it pretty much nailed an entire refactor in one go without any help, but in a different project it failed completely to the point that I had to just delete everything. I've tried exploring how things work when I go back-and-forth more, like debugging when the output from Codex doesn't work.

Codex MCP is just slow and I was running into issues with the setup that I don‚Äôt really have time to try to fully develop\n\nWhat I ended up settling on is just using Cursor with CC in terminal and gpt-5-codex as an agent, and passing the terminal as @context to cursor agent is really easy, or selecting the terminal output and ctrl+L to add it as context. I‚Äôm curious on how exactly you‚Äôre prompting codex to write the codes, right now I have a cursor command for whenever I attach a terminal snippet to critique the implantation and then write it","score":2,"author":"russian_cream","created":1758824834},{"id":"ng6kfm0","parentId":"ng67751","postId":"1nq68kq","depth":4,"text":"Ooo using cursor to manage the handoffs between the agents sounds really clean. The ease of passing the whole terminal as context would speed things up for me so much. I‚Äôm probably gonna have to spend my weekend messing around with cursor - I haven‚Äôt used cursor in quite a while and there weren‚Äôt many people talking about these kinds of multi agent orchestration workflows back then. Also using codex reply to try to sync context between both conversations sounds fantastic. I‚Äôve also run into some issues with how the codex MCP is set up though. \n\nRight now I really don‚Äôt do much myself to engineer my prompts for Codex. I‚Äôm a total Codex noob and I specifically subscribed so that I could test out how I could use it as a worker agent under Claude‚Äôs instructions. I haven‚Äôt set a system prompt or written an AGENTS.md or really customized it in any way yet, it‚Äôs basically just how it is out of the box. I‚Äôve put too much effort into the Claude side so it‚Äôs time to learn more about how to get the most out of Codex. \n\nI basically spend like up to 2-3+ hours just brainstorming and writing requirements with Claude. I treat that as if I were actually coding, with the goal of writing out requirements so detailed that any implementation of a listed feature could not possibly be any different than what I‚Äôd code myself without breaking the requirements. As we go I‚Äôll have it generate a bunch of different context files like ideas.md and PRD.md. \n\nOnce I‚Äôm ready to spin up Codex I‚Äôll have Claude give me a file with prompts for all the tasks we need to delegate - with metadata telling me which tasks can be run in parallel. Then I literally just copy whatever Claude gave me directly into Codex. Like I don‚Äôt even add in a ‚Äúhey Claude wrote these instructions‚Äù bit like I normally would. Claude knows what I‚Äôm doing so it adds those details. \n\nI know that sounds silly, and it is, but my goal so far has been exploring the limits and I‚Äôm only now starting the pare things down and try to formalize my workflow. I‚Äôve been completely shocked at how well this hands-off human out of the loop workflow has been able to execute tasks on its own from prompts where I didn‚Äôt write a single word. But it‚Äôs also had spectacular failures, generally because I was lazy and didn‚Äôt write a PRD detailed enough. It‚Äôs been a great learning experience and I‚Äôm stoked to see other people experimenting with similar workflows - it‚Äôs helped give me lots of ideas about how I might want to handle different edge cases and what we should do when we need to take a few steps backwards when something breaks. \n\nI‚Äôm excited to try out your cursor workflow. Now that I‚Äôve thoroughly stress tested this kind of system I‚Äôm super ready to take a more active human in the loop role again. And it just sounds like it‚Äôll be a lot more consistent. I‚Äôve had my fun testing the limits and now I‚Äôm working on keeping myself squarely within them.","score":2,"author":"ChillBallin","created":1758828755},{"id":"ngbs1yy","parentId":null,"postId":"1nq68kq","depth":0,"text":"codex is very good for hammering through a set of goal directed tasks - I preferred it to claude code for computing and reconciling my corporate tax filing with beancount\n\ni wouldnt use codex for building software that i have to maintain\n\nOne of the major problems you'll run into with codex is that it doesn't really keep you in the loop. so, especially with -high models, if you say one thing - even ask it a question -  it's going to take at least a minute for it to say anything to you. but, it may just as easily run off and do things for like 10 minutes that you didnt ask for.

I think this project has big potential to become even more popular, as Codex CLI usage grows now with the popularity of GPT-5, those who moved from Claude Code as a main coding CLI would definatelly appreciate the multi-terminal collaborative work. So for this reason I also believe having a unique name would help the project grow.\n\nMultiCode, MultiCodex, DualCode, DualCodex, CollabCodex could be potential names, but I think you should open up a naming suggestion initiative on the github main page, gather name suggestions, make a poll maybe. It's also important to remember it's still Codex at base - other forks chose to name like OpenCodex, AnonCodex, AnythingCodex so I think it's very important to keep the Codex name. But it's also very important to have something in the name to reveal it's about multi terminal / collaborative multi AI agents workflow.\n\nOther CLI allow for switching to another AI agent, but yours is special in that it can use 4 agents talking to each other - and does so locally by literally using the CLIs installed on the device.\n\nAlso a mention - apart from Claude Code and Gemini, I also have Qwen Coder CLI and it's correctly detected and used by Code, but I don't see any mention of Qwen on Code's github page, I think this could be mentioned there like compatible CLI tools.\n\nNot sure if a question or feature request, but for the user it's not clear which kind of AI model is actually being used in each of the Gemini/Claude/Qwen CLIs - is it Sonnet or Opus? Does it respect the reasoning set in Code or is that only applicable to the GPT-5 inside Codex?\n\nAlso, are there any other CLI tools supported, or even CLI tools that can run any custom models? ie: Grok CLI, OpenCode/Charm with any agent?\n\nI couldn't find any mentions of auto-updating (for example Claude Code autoupdates itself, while Codex atleast checks for new updates and notifies the user at start) - anything on this part that the users should know?","score":1,"author":"alexpopescu801","created":1758197951},{"id":"nezj3t6","parentId":"nevibdd","postId":"1ng46rw","depth":6,"text":"Thanks for the thoughtful feedback and suggestions!\n\n\n\nNaming is always tricky.

Opening a naming poll in a GitHub discussion is a good idea ‚Äì feel free to start one!\n\n\n\nAt the moment the CLI auto‚Äëdetects Claude Code, Gemini Code and ChatGPT Code (GPT‚Äë5) because those are the most stable and widely accessible. It will pick up other CLIs you have installed, so Qwen Coder should work even if it isn‚Äôt highlighted in the README. Support for Grok/OpenCode and other custom models is on our radar; you can already experiment with open‚Äësource models via the \\`--oss\\` flag and by integrating Model Context Protocol servers.\n\n\n\nRegarding which model is being used: Code simply defers to each provider's CLI. Claude Code defaults to Opus unless you override it with \\`--model\\`, Gemini CLI uses its Pro model, and GPT‚Äë5 is used for ChatGPT. The reasoning level you set in Code influences the prompts for GPT‚Äë5; the other agents have their own flags, so we‚Äôll document those better.\n\n\n\nYou're also right about auto‚Äëupdates. Claude Code updates itself; Code currently just notifies you when a new version is available so you can choose when to update.

Happy to build and test, but zero code.\n\nStarted this a couple weeks ago - the plan was to make an Android app that can RDP onto both a windows server and onto a Linux Ubuntu server running gnome-remote-desktop. Most apps in the play store don't work with the Linux RDP implementation or have crappy controls.\n\n  \nI've been jumping between Claude Code (Sonnet + Opus) and Codex to try and get this working.\n\n  \nUp until today both AI's have worked together to build FreeRDP in a WSL environment, then at the end of the shell script copy the output libs to my windows environment for the android app to use, but they have only ever been able to get windows RDP working - I was always getting a blank white screen on the linux gnome server - was connecting but no video.\n\n  \nToday, thought I'd try Sonnet 4.5 \"thinking\" - and what do you know, for the first time ever this app can now RDP onto windows AND Linux !\n\n  \nThis has been quite a shock to me because most of the time Sonnet 4 / Opus 4.1 would screw something up and cause a crash - Codex was the main force behind getting the app working, but within a few prompts Sonnet 4.5 has knocked it out the park.\n\n  \nI would guess I've spent about \\~10 hours on Codex and \\~15 hours on earlier versions of Claude trying to get this working, and Sonnet 4.5 has just completed it in around 30 minutes.\n\n  \nKudos to Sonnet 4.5, real world test for me personally has proved it (atleast in some categories) is better than Codex.\n\n  \nI'm not saying Sonnet 4.5 is a game changer or leaps and bounds beyond previous versions, but I have now proven to myself that this model is capable of things Codex + previous versions of Claude aren't.\n\n  \nSomewhat staring at my Linux Gnome server in disbelief on my Pixel 9 Pro...","score":2,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nuahor/claude_code_just_beat_codex_for_me_excited/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nuahor/claude_code_just_beat_codex_for_me_excited/","author":"Zilexion","created":1759231272,"numComments":4,"comments":[{"id":"nh5fk6k","parentId":null,"postId":"1nuahor","depth":0,"text":"Make sure you get all your code reviews by best tool like codeant.ai üòÖüòÖüòÖ","score":1,"author":"Peace_Seeker_1319","created":1759305454},{"id":"nh5hltz","parentId":"nh5fk6k","postId":"1nuahor","depth":1,"text":"My vote is for Entelligence.ai","score":1,"author":"figuring___out","created":1759306738}]}
{"postId":"1nqvcr6","subreddit":"codex","title":"My one-day deep dive on Codex vs. Claude Code vs. Cursor","selftext":"I spent the whole day deep-diving into Codex, and I'm seriously impressed. It genuinely feels like there‚Äôs a senior engineer behind the model. It gives you the sense that it's actually reading and understanding your code, not just running a glorified \\`grep\\` to find keywords and summarize them.\n\nFor instance, when I asked it to map out a plan for a new feature, it pointed to specific logic within a specific file, explained its purpose, and then laid out Options A, B, and C. It even added priorities, telling me which part to build first and which was optional. When it comes to pure programming, my gut feeling right now is that Codex \"gets\" coding the most.\n\nThis experience helped me form an initial mental model for these tools:\n\n**1. For Hardcore Programming:**\n\n\\- Codex is absolutely professional-grade. The strategies it suggests are built on a solid architectural mindset.\n\n\\- Cursor, by comparison, is more general-purpose. It's incredibly flexible if you know its tricks, and it's definitely more beginner-friendly.\n\n**2. For Tooling and Broader Workflows:**\n\n\\- Claude Code's main strength is its powerful Agent and toolchain ecosystem. The potential here is massive; its entire philosophy seems to be \"enhancing AI programming through tools.\"\n\n\\- Cursor also provides convenient plugins, but it relies more on the user to extend its capabilities.\n\n**Core Conclusion**\n\nThis leads me to a fundamental distinction in their approach:\n\n\\- Codex feels like: (Core Coding Model) + Agent. It starts with an extremely deep understanding of code, and then uses an Agent to execute tasks based on that understanding.\n\n\\- Claude Code feels like: (Core Agent) + Coding Ability. Its foundation is the Agent, which accomplishes tasks by calling on a variety of tools, one of which happens to be programming.\n\n**TL;DR Recommendation**\n\n\\- If you're after the purest, most hardcore coding experience, Codex seems to be the most powerful all-around choice right now.\n\n\\- If your workflow extends beyond just coding and you need powerful tool integration, Claude Code is your best bet.\n\n\\- Cursor sits nicely in the middle. It has the widest coverage and is probably the best entry point for most people.","score":29,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1nqvcr6/my_oneday_deep_dive_on_codex_vs_claude_code_vs/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1nqvcr6/my_oneday_deep_dive_on_codex_vs_claude_code_vs/","author":"Straight-Pace-4945","created":1758873176,"numComments":30,"comments":[{"id":"ngabc0h","parentId":null,"postId":"1nqvcr6","depth":0,"text":"Codex is so damn good.

I've used cchistory to generate the system prompt here: https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/cdef0dd5f216d5eb50fca12256a91b4d\n\nLot of BS in there and most of it is untouchable unless you use the Claude Agent SDK, but that's a rant for another time.\n\n## Output Styles: What Changes\n\nI generated three versions to show you exactly what's happening:\n\n1. **With an output style:** https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/b51fa3c215ee8867368fdae02eb89a04\n2. **With --append-system-prompt:** https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/86e6895336348bfdeebe4ba50bce6470\n3. **Side-by-side diff:** https://www.diffchecker.com/LJSYvHI2/\n\n**Key differences when you use an output style:**\n\n- Line 18 changes to mention the output style below, specifically calling out to \"help users according to your 'Output Style'\" and \"how you should respond to user queries.\"\n\n- The \"## Tone and style\" header is removed entirely. These instructions are pretty light. HOWEVER, there are some important things you will want to preserve if you continue to use Claude Code for development:\n\n  - Sections relating to erroneous file creation\n  - Emojis callout\n  - Objectivity\n\n- The \"## Doing tasks\" header is removed as well. This section is largely useless and repetitive. Although do not forget to include similar details in your output style to keep it aligned to the task, however literally anything you write will be superior, if I'm being honest. Anthropic needs to do better here...\n\n- The \"## Output Style: Test Output Style\" header exists now! The \"Test Output Style\" is the name of my output style I used to generate this. What is below the header is exactly as I have in my test output style.\n\n**Important placement note:** You might notice the output style is directly above the tools definition, which since the tools definitions are a disorganized, poorly written, bloated mess, this is actually closer to the start of the system prompt than the end.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n- LLMs maintain context best from the start and ending of a large prompt\n- Since these instructions are relatively close to the start, adherence is quite solid in my experience, even with context windows larger than >180k tokens\n- However, I found instruction adherence to begin to degrade after >120k tokens, sometimes as early as >80k tokens in the context\n\n## --append-system-prompt: Where It Goes\n\nNow if you look at the --append-system-prompt example we see once again, this is appended DIRECTLY above the tools definitions.\n\n**If you use both:**\n\n- Output style is placed above the appended system prompt\n\n**Pro tip:** In my VSC devcontainer, I have it configured to create a Claude command alias to append a specific file to the system prompt upon launch. (Simplified the script so you can use it too: https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/ea1ac2b744737dcf008f581033935b23)\n\n## Discovering the --system-prompt Flag (v2.0.14)\n\nNow, primarily the reason for why I have chosen today to finally share this information is because v2.0.14's changelog mentions they documented a new flag called \"--system-prompt.\" Now, maybe they documented the code internally, or I don't know the magic word, but as far as I can tell, no they fucking did not.\n\n**Where I looked and came up empty:**\n\n- `claude --help` at the time of writing this\n- Their docs where other flags are documented\n- Their documentation AI said it doesn't exist\n- Couldn't find any info on it anywhere\n\nSo I forked cchistory again since my old fork I had done similar but in a really stupid way so just started over, fixed the critical issues, then set it up to use my existing Claude Code instance instead of downloading a fresh one which satisfied my own feature request from a few months ago which I made before deciding I'd do it myself. This is how I was able to test and document the --system-prompt flag.\n\nWhat --system-prompt actually does:\n\nThe --system-prompt flag finally added SOME of what I've been bitching about for a while. This flag replaces the entire system prompt except:\n\n- The bloated tool definitions (I get why, but I BEG you Anthropic, let me rewrite them myself, or disable the ones I can just code myself, give me 6 warning prompts I don't care, your tool definitions suck and you should feel bad. :( )\n- A single line: \"You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.\"\n\nExample system prompt using \"--system-prompt '[PINEAPPLE]'\": https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/e85ff48952c1e0b4e2fe73fbd560029c\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nClaude Code's system prompt is finally, mostly (if it weren't for the bloated tool definitions, but I digress) customizable!\n\n**The good news:**\n\n- With Anthropic's exceptional instruction hierarchy training and adherence, anything added to the system prompt will actually MOSTLY be followed\n- You have way more control now\n\n**The catch:**\n\n- The real secret to getting the most out of your LLM is walking that thin line of just enough context for the task‚Äînot too much, not too little\n- If you're throwing 10,000 tokens into the system prompt on top of these insane tool definitions (11,438 tokens for JUST tools!!! WTF Anthropic?!) you're going to exacerbate context rot issues\n\n**Bonus resource:**\n\n- **Anthropic token estimator** (actually uses Anthropic's API see https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens): https://claude-tokenizer.vercel.app/\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR (Generated by Claude Code, edited by me)\n\nClaude Code v2.0.14 has three ways to customize system prompts, but they're poorly documented. I reverse-engineered them using a fork of cchistory:\n\n1. Output Styles: Replaces the \"Tone and style\" and \"Doing tasks\" sections. Gets placed near the start of the prompt, above tool definitions, for better adherence. Use this for changing how Claude operates and responds.\n\n2. --append-system-prompt: Adds your instructions right above the tool definitions. Stacks with output styles (output style goes first). Good for adding specific behaviors without replacing existing instructions.\n\n3. --system-prompt (NEW in v2.0.14): Replaces the ENTIRE system prompt except tool definitions and one line about being a Claude agent. This is the nuclear option - gives you almost full control but you're responsible for everything.\n\nAll three inject instructions above the tool definitions (11,438 tokens of bloat). Key insight: LLMs maintain context best at the start and end of prompts, and since tools are so bloated, your custom instructions end up closer to the start than you'd think, which actually helps adherence.\n\nBe careful with token count though - context rot kicks in around 80-120k (my note: technically as early as 8k, but starts to become more of a noticable issue at this point) tokens even though the window is larger. Don't throw 10k tokens into your system prompt on top of the existing bloat or you'll make things worse.\n\nI've documented all three approaches with examples and diffs in the post above. Check the gists for actual system prompt outputs so you can see exactly what changes.\n\n----\n\n[Title Disclaimer: Technically there are other methods, but they don't apply to Claude Code interactive mode.]\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to comment, if you're shy, I'm more than happy to help in DM's but my replies may be slow, apologies.\n","score":32,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o65jva/understanding_claude_codes_3_system_prompt/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o65jva/understanding_claude_codes_3_system_prompt/","author":"CodeMonke_","created":1760414620,"numComments":10,"comments":[{"id":"njedgpt","parentId":null,"postId":"1o65jva","depth":0,"text":"This is quality content.

If you find some instruction being consistently ignored, or having to apply an instruction to every single conversation, adding it to the system prompt ensures stricter adherence to the instructions, as the system prompt is sent with every request.\n\nThe use varies a lot, if you switch the system prompt a lot, output styles might be better. You could have the system prompt modified based on the task you're doing, feeding task specific or project specific knowledge to the system prompt. Granted outside of output styles, this requires a claude code restart to use an updated flag, but all of these work even when resuming a conversation, so you can modify the system prompt mid-conversation. I'm working on something to support this, by injecting relevant memories directly into the system prompt, and in the background I'm restarting claude code with a new system prompt every message, carefully targeted to the specific task.\n\nMy problem a lot of the time is I will tell claude not to create markdown files unless asked, well 80k tokens in this instruction starts getting lost because it was 70k tokens ago, context rot is kicking in, and now its trying to write markdown files. I add the instruction to the system prompt, I don't encounter issues with adherence 95% of the time even above >150k tokens.\n\nYou can add additional context on mcp tool usage, use an output style with writing examples to get it to help you with creative writing tasks while preserving your voice. (Examples are powerful in the system prompt) You can include the filetree if its having consistent navigation issues.\n\nBasically, figure out what claude is failing to do correctly and annoying you, then figure out a prompt snippet to add to the system prompt to prevent it from doing that thing, is one of the main use cases. Remember though, negative instructions often result in seeding it to do the very thing you told it not to, my strategy is to lead every negative instruction with a positive instruction, and avoid strong language, example: \"Favor writing detailed docblocks for all methods, following google's docblock standards, avoid writing incomplete or 'lazy' docblocks and employ the full docblock spec to the greatest extent warranted by the code's complexity.\"\n\nBasically instead of DO x, DON'T y, use FAVOR x, AVOID y. I've found it to have a nearly equal effect, without potentially seeding it to do the negative instruction.","score":4,"author":"CodeMonke_","created":1760421045},{"id":"njgvyw0","parentId":"njek0em","postId":"1o65jva","depth":2,"text":"I still use them per project but my user(global) [claude.md](http://claude.md) is empty.

You HAVE to babysit it and work back and forth with it.\n\nYou may ask, why do i expect it to work on such big functionality and implement it at once ?\n\nWell, i do that with Codex and it does work like that on my backend engineering and follows plan. It does not claim to have done it in single shot and say its \"PRODUCTION READY\". Instead, it proposes to split the implementation into logical chunks itself and does it incrementally step by step. And on each step it mostly does it flawlessly (at least it builds and tests pass lmao)\n\nSo yeah even if you are hardcore Claude fan you might as well get a 20$ Codex subscription for bugfixes and checking what Claude did. NEVER trust Claude blindly. It hallucinates all the time and claims to do everything but never does even if you are VERY SPECIFIC and provide it with clean instructions.\n\nI wish CODEX was trained more on front-end stuff.\n\nI suck at front-end and i hate front-end this is why i have to \"vibecode\" it.

My suggestion: W3Schools is underappreciated and EVERYONE uses it wrong, by googling. Sign up and start at HTML and click through the tutorials, it's designed to teach you everything you should learn in order (to build upon prior knowledge, such as learning basics before moving to frameworks, etc.):\n\ne.g. HTML > CSS > JAVASCRIPT > SQL > PYTHON > JAVA > PHP > HOW TO > W3.CSS > C > C++ > C# > BOOTSTRAP > REACT > MYSQL > JQUERY > EXCEL > XML > DJANGO > NUMPY > PANDAS > NODEJS > DSA > TYPESCRIPT > ANGULAR > ANGULARJS > GIT > POSTGRESQL > MONGODB > ASP > AI > R > GO > KOTLIN > SASS > VUE > GEN AI > SCIPY > CYBERSECURITY > DATA SCIENCE > INTRO TO PROGRAMMING > BASH > RUST\n\nYou do that and you'll be better off than 99% of dev's.

I've tried Codex and had some success.  Claude Code is the most consistently useful platform for development and the one I've successfully built my primary application plus numerous scripts, tools, and experiments. The CLI beats out Codex by a mile.  Especially now that token usage is on the status line.\n\nYes, yes, yes there's **problems**. Of course. AI-assisted coding overall has a long way to go to realize the dream of just talking to a computer and it magically reads your mind and builds whatever you want.  Yes, you really need to be a developer in some capacity; or some type of engineering skill.  You have to have the logical troubleshooting skills programmers use even though you're not looking directly at the code much of the time.  The same troubleshooting process takes place with AI tools.\n\nOverall, I've learned that what I'm really building is an AI system that builds the application(s) I want. i.e. I'm not using Typescript to program a SaaS app.  I'm using prompts, [claude.md](http://claude.md), scripts, hooks, etc to construct a system that properly creates the app I want.  And the core engine keeps changing requiring adapation on the daily.\n\nOpenSpec has been a game changer. Git Worktrees when using multiple agents. Defining a process in [claude.md](http://claude.md) that tells Claude to maintain status reports, validate requirements, test, and commit even though Claude doesn't always follow it.  All super useful. Definitely looking for better implementation of hooks and scripts to make sure task are implemented (single scripts that find information, validate and test, commit, and more - then just tell Claude in [claude.md](http://claude.md) to execute those single commands in sequence.\n\nThe real game changer may come with clients that use the Claude SDK and implement the software development lifecycle, worktrees, and all the rest that have to go around it - Crystal (u/radial\\_symmetry) , Just Every Code - let me know if there are other options you've discovered.\n\nThanks u/Anthropic!","score":4,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o35s30/happy_with_claude_code/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o35s30/happy_with_claude_code/","author":"jonathanmalkin","created":1760113917,"numComments":8,"comments":[{"id":"nisrsgf","parentId":null,"postId":"1o35s30","depth":0,"text":"Paid Chatbot ?

{"postId":"1o0im7l","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"I tested Claude 4.5 Sonnet with CC and GPT-5 codex: I found my frontend eng  in Claude 4.5 and  backend eng in GPT-5","selftext":"I have been using Codex for a while (since Sonnet 4 was nerfed), it has so far has been a great experience. But, Codex never let me not miss Claude Code. It's just not at the level of CC. And now that Sonnet 4.5 is here. I really wanted to test which model among Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-codex offers more value per bucks.\n\nSo, I built an e-com app (I named it vibeshop as it is vibe coded) using both the models using CC and Codex CLI with respective LLMs, also added MCP to the mix for a complete agent coding setup.\n\nI created a monorepo and used various packages to see how well the models could handle context. I built a clothing recommendation engine in TypeScript for a serverless environment to test performance under realistic constraints (I was really hoping that these models would make the architectural decisions on their own, and tell me that this can't be done in a serverless environment because of the computational load). The app takes user preferences, ranks outfits, and generates clean UI layouts for web and mobile.\n\nHere's what I found out.\n\n**Observations on Claude perf**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 started strong. It handled the design beautifully, with pixel-perfect layouts, proper hierarchy, and clear explanations of each step. I could never have done this lol. But as the project grew, it struggled with smaller details, like schema relations and handling HttpOnly tokens mapped to opaque IDs with TTL/cleanup to prevent spoofing or cross-user issues.\n\n**Observations on GPT-5-codex**\n\nGPT-5 Codex, on the other hand, had a better handling of the situation. It maintained context better, refactored safely, and produced working code almost immediately (though it still had some linter errors like unused variables). It understood file dependencies, handled cross-module logic cleanly, and seemed to ‚Äúget‚Äù the project structure better. The only downside was the developer experience of Codex, the docs are still unclear and there is limited control, but the output quality made up for it.\n\nBoth models still produced long-running queries that would be problematic in a serverless setup. It would‚Äôve been nice if they flagged that upfront, but you still see that architectural choices require a human designer to make final calls. By the end, Codex delivered the entire recommendation engine with fewer retries and far fewer context errors. Claude‚Äôs output looked cleaner on the surface, but Codex‚Äôs results actually held up in production.\n\nClaude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend.\n\n**Cost comparison:**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 + Claude Code: \\~18M input + 117k output tokens, cost around $10.26. Produced more lint errors but UI looked clean.  \nGPT-5 Codex + Codex Agent: \\~600k input + 103k output tokens, cost around $2.50. Fewer errors, clean UI, and better schema handling.\n\nI wrote a full breakdown¬†[Claude 4.5 Sonnet vs GPT-5 Codex](https://composio.dev/blog/claude-sonnet-4-5-vs-gpt-5-codex-best-model-for-agentic-coding),  \nIf anyone wants to see both models in action. also you can find the code results in this¬†[repo.](http://github.com/rohittcodes/fashion-hub)\n\nWould love to hear what others think. Is Claude actually slipping in coding performance, or is GPT-5 Codex just evolving faster than we expected?

I'm a mac/linux user so I could use some help ironing out any issues in the windows install/setup process.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmh2nk3i4jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=740215a96f7a4519b56adf5901fe68353641eac2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bvz0k3i4jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=5521b07c73fcafc837ac9bac1d75bc80d34000c0\n\ndsfdsf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fy15u3i4jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a77718c53e3addcc27389a4216c7c669d907835\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38x7el3i4jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=056f7741d0849e4f84fb44789ab268d25c2d1141\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qddrht4x4jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=08732e300281c44cd568ffe4830dc34781e2c8ab\n\n\\*\\*The Core Idea:\\*\\*\n\nFelix indexes your codebase into a semantic knowledge graph, then exposes it via MCP so AI assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.) can intelligently navigate, search, and modify your project. The AI gets exactly the context it needs ‚Äì no more, no less.  Together you create tasks, documentation, coding rules...and they all get indexed and linked together with your code and file based documentation.  While your ai codes, it follows tasks that are created in EXTREME detail and gets intelligent context-relevant rules injected with prompts and during tool usage.\n\n\\*\\*MCP-First Architecture:\\*\\*\n\nThe MCP server is the heart of Felix. AI assistants can:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Semantic search\\*\\* across code, docs, tasks, and rules simultaneously\n\n\\- \\*\\*Multi-level context queries\\*\\*: Get just component IDs, full source + relationships, or deep dependency trees\n\n\\- \\*\\*Relational queries\\*\\*: \"Show me all functions that call X\" or \"Find components related to authentication\"\n\n\\- \\*\\*Smart context generation\\*\\*: Returns code WITH related documentation snippets, applicable rules, and linked notes\n\n\\- \\*\\*Context compacting\\*\\*: Multiple view modes (skeleton, files+lines, full source) to fit token budgets\n\n\\- \\*\\*Lens-based context\\*\\*: Focus on specific relationships (callers, callees, imports, inheritance, data-flow)\n\n\\- \\*\\*Token-budget awareness\\*\\*: Specify max tokens, Felix prioritizes and truncates intelligently\n\nExample: Ask for a component's context, and Felix returns the source code + callers/callees + relevant documentation + applicable coding rules + related tasks ‚Äì all within your specified token budget.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wi3seke15jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=b784ce98a750d3892025ea2c546453f4ca2b2d85\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xt8q7f15jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=d924f6df671e633755f1f814a9c43c2383e55913\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyq0oie15jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a226be3548f0ef9031ba5a2ab30493cc2314ba0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/et34oke15jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ea0ce581ecd729e916757798701128bdf36412\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clfayox55jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=782bc02306d6fb3bd7d03d09814fdfb5fa7020f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzll2px55jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9352d03324b6ab26651a554cc20e0f37720a390\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vsgkpx55jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=43a11bbf2a9c1653949ec9dd7b4db0bc4149a94a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4509ox55jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cf47ee0eed391108a9d4667a8b9e9271db7d20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqwihpx55jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7f762be72e21d95abd9a697099a1d1cf687c18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttyu6l5b5jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6fd15c98711f617d66f50e99a8388b091b16755\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osp2cdyb5jtf1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=a844841807b64df58a850a8c50e0cdf74107bd3f\n\n\\*\\*Multi-Backend

{"postId":"1nziovg","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"I am disappointed with the limits in Claude even having a MAX plan for $200 and after Codex verification, I will be another person giving up on Claude, details in the description.","selftext":"I have been using Claude code for a long time, practically from the beginning when it was created, and it has completely changed the way I use AI. I don't know so much about code, but since AI is doing well with programming I started creating a couple of applications at the beginning to automate for myself and then streamline things at home. Claude Code, Sonnet 4 and Opus helped me a lot to develop technical skills and thanks to it I have things like automatic opening and closing of blinds or sending alarms when smoke detectors detect something, home lab and smart home is a big area of activities and possibilities.\n\nAlthough there were sometimes limits I used Opus and Sonnet intensively. I didn't complain too much because the limits were sometimes reached at most an hour before the next 5-hour session.\nThings started to break down when weekly limits were introduced. Limits fluctuated terribly, sometimes it was better (but not like before the introduction of weekly limits), sometimes it was so bad that the limits in a 5 hour session ended after 1 hour....\nMy plan didn't change, the way I use it did too.\nThe last 2 weeks have been tragic, because after about 3 days I used up the entire weekend limit.\nIf the Anthropic team says that it does not change the limits then for me it is a simple lie, it is impossible to attract similar habits and use in a similar way so drastically change the limits.\n\nI'll get to the main point, so as not to write too much.\nI've been testing Codex for a week having the usual $20 plan.\n\nFor 4 days I used similarly to Claude codex.... And only at the 4th day I had a limit. And not the cheapest model available just usually used the better ones. Codex has its downsides, but it can all be worked out and set up to achieve better accuracy similar to Claude, although in some cases Codex does better.\n\nI know that OpenAI is probably losing a lot of money on this, and I know that it probably won't last very long, but even if they make it 2 or 3 times worse it will still be better than with Claude, who can with a $200 plan limit access after 1 day. \nChatgpt's $20 plan and even more so the $200 plan is worth the money unlike Claude, which was great in the beginning and has now deteriorated.\n\nAnthropic is going the way of Cursor, and it's not a good way because Cursor blatantly scams people, changes limits every different day and purposely worsens the performance of models through its layer just to make it cheaper.\n\nAt this point I am switching from claude to Codex and will gladly pay them $200 if necessary than $200 claude, which does not want to see its users.\n\nAnd all because of the stupid decision of weekend capping. It was enough to ban forever those who used the limits 24 hours a day all week and overtaxed the resources, and give honest users full freedom, then of course because of some idiots who bragged here and created videos how claude works alone 24 hours a day Anthropic had to give a weekend limit. As far as I'm concerned they seized the moment to limit access to everyone because maintenance was too expensive, and that was just an excuse to implement limits.\n\nSonnet 4.5 will not save the situation, and if it goes on like this, OpenAI will garner more users than Anthropic. \nPersonally, I feel cheated because I pay so much for only 1 day limit without giving any information that the limits are changing.\n\nAnd if not OpenAI, Chinese models are available to choose from at a good price, or even for free \n\nTime to wake up and be competitive.","score":65,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nziovg/i_am_disappointed_with_the_limits_in_claude_even/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nziovg/i_am_disappointed_with_the_limits_in_claude_even/","author":"CacheConqueror","created":1759756359,"numComments":21,"comments":[{"id":"ni2om2c","parentId":null,"postId":"1nziovg","depth":0,"text":"I‚Äôm on Max 20x ($200/month) and I‚Äôve already burned through my entire weekly limit - now I have to wait until Thursday evening just to work again.

Most Pro users can expect 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 within their weekly usage limits.\n\n* This will vary based on factors such as codebase size and user settings like auto-accept mode. Users running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel will hit their limits sooner.\n\n\"\n\nI generally hit 5 hour limits with 1.5-2 hours of medium-heavy work, which is approximately the same as before the 4.5 update, so I do not see 4.5 being faster at consuming tokens than 4.0 according to 5 hour limits.\n\nRight now I am sitting at 3 days 2/3 sessions hitting the limit + sometimes a very small 4th session, let's normalize it to 8 sessions (Generous estimation). I am at 80% weekly usage and yellow \"Approaching weekly limit\" shows up in UI. I usually hit a 5 hour limit in 1.5-2 hours of medium to heavy use, normalize to 2h (again generous).  8\\*2 = 16; 16/8\\*10 (to achieve 100% usage) = \\~20 hours of usage alloted per week. **It is HALF of the MINIMUM range they are providing.**\n\nI do not use parallel or sub-agents, my codebase for the last-few-days project is not very large (about 10k lines frontend and 5k lines backend + a few docs for work organization which I think conserve tokens in the long run rather than spend) and I do not have a lot of mcps, I use CC in a single chat/terminal session. I also generally try to manage context for CC so it doesn't need to read too many files, conserving context so I do not have to run /compact too much (I generally prefer it to a completely new session just because of convenience).\n\nHere are the exact commit line numbers since the start of this week (right after reset) for even more detailed view into this, this includes code changes (including repeated), documentation changes etc.:\n\n     Commits (487cf28..HEAD):\n      - 10,601 insertions(+)\n      - 5,865 deletions(-)\n      - 16,466 total changed lines in commits\n    \n      Current staged changes:\n      - 955 insertions(+)\n      - 29 deletions(-)\n      - 984 total changed lines staged\n    \n      Grand total: 17,450 changed lines\n\n\\+ any reworks inside commits, which there were not a lot.

I signed up for both about four months ago specifically because of Opus - when used as an Agent, opus is the only model that I could rely on to make changes to my production code without constant micromanagement.\n\nOpus would follow instructions in claude.md, and if it ran into issues, would intelligently think through solutions instead of blindly steaming on ahead.\n\nI used opus on one $200 account, and loved it so much I shelled out for a second $200 account - one worked on my mobile app and the other on my backend and web app. I would often approach the five hour limit, and whenever I got that message I would just take a break - using sonnet was just not worth it because I had to tell it exactly what to do to keep it from blindly breaking things.\n\nWell, then they release sonnet 4.5 which IS better than 4.0 - but it makes the same dumb mistakes as the previous sonnet: when it hits a problem it just blindly picks a solution instead of thinking. So I stuck with opus. But I hit my weekly limit on both accounts in less than one day and now I can‚Äôt use it again until October 9.\n\nSo now I‚Äôm back to meticulously micro managing sonnet 4.5. But I‚Äôm wondering: why pay $400/month when I still have to micro? Why not just use $20 codex?\n\nBecause gpt5 is just as smart as opus. I heavily prefer the Claude code user experience and sub agent implementation, but when it comes to making decisions gpt5 is just as smart for 1/10th the cost (I know OpenAI is losing money but for the moment gpt5 is cheap)\n\nI wasn‚Äôt abusing opus - when I hit the limit I opened a second account.

A lot of people just call B.S. because they are either skeptical or ignorant, so they ask for \"proof\" of everything.\n\nI was compelled to make a video of a real, living breathing person (me), running a real business that makes real money, and using AI to write all of the code. You can watch it at [https://youtu.be/NuZHqkOymYI](https://youtu.be/NuZHqkOymYI)\n\nSurely, this still won't be enough for some people, because they just can't see the writing on the wall. But this app will soon run my entire course training business and is currently working with 15,000+ students. Not to mention, my career and livelihood depend on it to run effectively.\n\nAI did NOT take my agency away. Not anyone can do this -- the only reason it worked is because I know how code works and understand how to architect systems and define requirements. I've essentially been a super technical PM/SA for the last 7 or 8 years, and have kinda been out of writing any of the code myself. But Claude Code has reignited my passion for dev, and I'm now finding myself able to build lots of cool things with code very quickly and at a very high level of quality.\n\nThe platform's called Codex (ironically named, but I named it before that \"previous\" company did because I thought it aligned well for my business -- essentially a rolodex of code). And it's running everything new for my company, and was built just about completely with Claude Code + Sonnet/Opus.\n\nI built a full, complete exam-taking system that is super complex, but is exactly what I set out to build. Students can take time exams, get a full detailed breakdown of results, share them with others, etc. The platform should have taken well over a year to build, but all of its functionality as well as the core course platform features were all built in 3 months.\n\nIt feels like I'm coding both more and less at the same time. More because I'm constantly shipping code, but less because I'm not writing any of it. It's really bizarre.\n\nI'm sure there are devs & architects out there building real, actual stuff and having AI write all of it? But I haven't seen many posts about this myself, so I thought it was prudent to put together a video and share it as \"proof of work(ing, complex app in production that makes real money)\"\n\nI thought this subreddit may find this interesting.

{"postId":"1nwtv4j","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Tested GPT-5 Codex vs Claude Sonnet 4.5 vs Kimi K2 on a real refactor task","selftext":"PS: Originally shared by a community member in the Codex Discord, reposting here for visibility. \n\nToday I ran a side-by-side experiment: I gave three different coding models the exact same task - refactor some tightly-coupled database ops into a single package, optimize INSERTs with time-based batching, and rewrite a handful of stored procedures into native Go. The repo is a big mono-repo with multiple build targets, so there was plenty of surface area.\n\n**Results:**\n\n* **GPT-5 Codex (medium)** Changed 23 files across the codebase. It was slowest, but it covered everything: updated [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md), refactored all build targets, adapted existing test files, and basically just got it right. Honestly felt like a senior dev who actually read the codebase.\n* **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)** Only touched 11 files. It half-assed the job by creating the new package but leaving old references all over the place. Didn‚Äôt bother with tests. The style felt like junior-level output, like a trainee poking around. It was the fastest, but very sloppy.\n* **Kimi K2 (Opencode Zen)** Made changes to 15 files. Missed one build target (so \\~25% incomplete) but the actual solution was clean and pragmatic. Reading the diff, it looked almost exactly how I would have written it myself. The catch: cost came out to **$4.11**, which is pricey for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGPT-5 Codex is still way ahead - slower, but the only one that really nailed the whole task. Claude Sonnet seems to have taken a step backwards with 4.5, optimizing for speed/token usage at the expense of quality. Kimi K2 is solid and pragmatic, probably the best open source option if you‚Äôre okay with the price.\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed the same: Codex being comprehensive, Claude regressing, Kimi feeling closest to human-like pragmatic output.

{"postId":"1nwgwp4","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Garbage in garbage out","selftext":"I‚Äôm a Claude Code user on Max x5, having started my journey a couple of months ago. I experienced quality degradation over the past few weeks but noticed recovery around two weeks ago. My theory is that resources were diverted to Sonnet 4.5 development and have since been restored.\n\nDuring that period, I managed by planning with Opus and executing with Sonnet, though results were mixed.\n\nMy brief trial of Codex was disappointing‚Äîlots of explanations with zero actionable results‚Äîso I decided to stick with Claude.\n\nNow with Sonnet 4.5, I‚Äôm extremely satisfied. I haven‚Äôt touched Opus since, have resolved numerous pending issues, and have only used 3% of my weekly limit.\n\nBased on many complaints I‚Äôve seen here, I believe there‚Äôs a fundamental misunderstanding about what‚Äôs currently achievable with these tools.\n\nCode-based LLMs are primarily trained on existing codebases‚Äîlikely open-source projects, though Anthropic may have access to some proprietary ones as well. With upcoming privacy changes, user prompts and code inputs will likely play an increasingly important role.\n\nThe average code quality across millions of open-source projects is, at best, ‚Äúaverage‚Äù‚Äîa few exceptional examples get diluted by much lower-quality code.\n\nI don‚Äôt view LLMs as magic converters that turn garbage into gold, but rather as tools that excel at routine tasks.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a top-tier developer who understands how a team of five normally-skilled developers would perform, you can achieve comparable or even better output at a fraction of the cost.\n\nHowever, this requires deep understanding‚Äîyou need to grasp what you‚Äôre building well enough to do most of it yourself. The difference is that you can now focus on being the software architect rather than the coder.\n\nWith Claude Code, I can now accomplish solo what would previously have required either ten times the hours or a team of, say, three junior and two senior developers. Anyone who‚Äôs managed such a team knows it requires substantial input to get things done right.\n\nSo as the title suggests: if your architectural input is poor, Claude Code won‚Äôt magically transform it. But if you plan well and possess strong oversight and deep understanding, you can accomplish things individually that were previously impossible.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã","score":12,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nwgwp4/garbage_in_garbage_out/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nwgwp4/garbage_in_garbage_out/","author":"franzel_ka","created":1759441168,"numComments":7,"comments":[{"id":"nhg84ru","parentId":null,"postId":"1nwgwp4","depth":0,"text":"I totally agree.

Co incidence ?  I think not.\n\n>With Claude Code, I can now accomplish solo what would previously have required either ten times the hours or a team of, say, three junior and two senior developers. Anyone who‚Äôs managed such a team knows it requires substantial input to get things done right.\n\nThis is so true. Well said.\n\nOne of the great things about Claude versus working with a human team is that a) his fixes are instantaneous and b) he had endless patience for making changes or trying things.\n\nWith a team there is usually a communication pipeline that issues much go through... create an incident/change report, etc.  Usually the developers are busy working on something, so they'll get to it when they'll get to it.  Then it takes a while to figure things out and make the change.  With a human team the test -> find -> document -> fix -> test loop is at least hours if not days.\n\nWith Claude this loop is minutes.  I use Claude as a pair programming partner, with him doing most of the coding and me transforming the story into prompts, gathering data to support the use case, generating the prompts, then quality checking the code that got generated, sometimes cleaning it up, testing it and issuing prompts for changes and bug fixes.  All this in Agile fashion, incrementally.  Always be shipping.   \n\nClaude and I can write, test and fix up code incredibly fast, because the loop is so tight and fast.   My head is still in the context of the issue and my tools are still set up when I get the fixed code back.  There is no documentation delay - things are handled immediately.  I know the use case of the features we are adding, I don't need to formally communicate them to a team.  And if I mess up, Claude is very quick to make code changes. \n\nI'm very happy with Claude.","score":3,"author":"yycTechGuy","created":1759446129},{"id":"nhg57ol","parentId":null,"postId":"1nwgwp4","depth":0,"text":"That's nice to hear, I've been really enjoying Sonnet 4.5, and most of the comments in this sub are complaints, esp. from Opus heavy users\n\nCould you share a little more regarding the process you follow, and what are the differences in your planning process using Opus vs Sonnet 4.5?

Having started developing almost 50 years ago, AI coding is just a tiny drop in an ocean of accumulated knowledge for me. This allows me to work much faster without a team and implement new things I haven't done before, but can grasp from a higher-level perspective.\n\nFor example, my current project uses a lot of PHP‚Äîa language I'd never encountered before. Now it's like learning a foreign language when you already speak three fluently and understand several more. I'm glad Claude can handle most of it, but naturally, I can immediately spot problematic or missing parts.\n\nAI will transform the future for all of us, and the challenge for developers will be the same as in school: still learning all the basics.

I can't afford adding another subscription like Cursor or Codex on top of that.\n\nClaude's outputs are great though, so I've basically figured out how to squeeze everything I can out of Pro within those 5-hour windows:\n\nI plan a lot. I use Claude Web sometimes, but mostly Gemini 2.5 Pro on AI Studio to plan stuff out, make markdown files, double-check them in other chats to make sure they're solid, then hand it all to Claude Code to actually write.\n\nI babysit Claude Code hard. Always watching what it's doing so I can jump in with more instructions or stop it immediately if needed. Never let it commit anything - I do all commits myself.\n\nI'm up at 5am and I send a quick \"hello\" to kick off my first session. Then between 8am and 1pm I can do a good amount of work between my first session and the next one. I do like 3 sessions a day.\n\nI almost never touch Opus. Just not worth the usage hit.\n\nTracking usage used to suck and I was using \"Claude Usage Tracker\" (even donated to the dev), but now Anthropic gave us the /usage thing which is amazing.

When I check the context usage, a big chunk of tokens is already consumed just by listing MCP tools (e.g. `mcp__sentry_*`, `mcp__chrome-devtools_*`, `mcp__context7_*`, etc.).\n\nThe weird part: I never actually invoked those tools, but their full definitions still get injected into the context. In my case this takes **tens of thousands of tokens right from the start**, leaving much less room for my actual code or conversation.\n\nSo I have a few questions for the community:\n\n* Is this *normal behavior* (i.e. unavoidable overhead when MCP tools are available)?\n* Is there any way to **disable MCP tools** I don‚Äôt need, or **enable them only on demand**?\n* Can the initial ‚Äútool discovery‚Äù be turned off, so the context doesn‚Äôt get filled until I explicitly ask to use that tool?\n\nRight now it feels like a huge waste of context space, especially for longer coding sessions.

{"postId":"1nu9qc9","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Question: Claude Code vs Codex vs Gemini CLI vs Cursor","selftext":"Hello everyone.\n\nThe title of the post basically summarizes my question. I just want to give a little context in order to clarify what kind of model I am looking for.\n\nI am currently working on a heavy research project that is going to take a few weeks and probably 2 to 3 thousands of lines of code (maybe even more, I am yet to discover the extent of the project). The project's main purpose revolves around creating a machine learning model.\n\nI am not a genius coder nor do I have years of experience in programming. Therefore, I will rely heavily on Al models when it comes to implementation (I do not need heavy reasoning since I know what I need to do, I just need strong implementation with minimal errors). I prefer quality over quantity. I wouldn't want my tokens to run out every 15 minutes or wait weeks for them to refresh, but I wouldn't risk any quality issues over these factors.\n\nI also do not have a large budget. For instance, if I were to opt for Claude Code, I would go for the Pro plan. The same goes for Codex, I would opt for the Plus plan (both being 20$/month).\n\nI have been investigating these four models for the last few days. To my knowledge, Claude and Codex are the two that are more refined right now, compared to Gemini CLI and Cursor. However, I have seen mixed opinions about Claude and Codex. Both seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. They also seem to be quite similar.\n\nFor my final question, considering my situation, which model should I opt for?\n\nThanks to everyone that has read and will read my post.","score":1,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nu9qc9/question_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_gemini_cli_vs/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nu9qc9/question_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_gemini_cli_vs/","author":"GnomesInMyHome","created":1759228724,"numComments":0,"comments":[]}

I didn't see mistakes like this at all before.\n\nthe context window degradation is obvious too. it used to maintain awareness of 4-5 related files across a conversation. now it forgets what we discussed more often. i'll reference \"the function we just modified\" and get back \"i dont see that function in the file\" even tho we literally just edited it together.\n\ni'm pretty sure whats happening is theyre either:\n\n1. using a distilled/quantized version of the model to save on inference costs\n2. reducing context window size dynamically based on load\n3. implementing some kind of quality-of-service throttling that they don't disclose\n\nthe pattern is too consistent to be random. \n\nand before someone replies with \"context engineering\" or \"skill issue\" - i've been writing software for 12 years. i know how to decompose problems, provide context, and iterate on solutions. the issue isn't prompt quality, its that the model capabilities have observably degraded over a 6 week period while costs have increased.\n\nthis is basically the playbook: attract users with unsustainable pricing/quality, then slowly degrade the experience once theyre locked in and restructure workflows around your tool. i've seen it happen with nearly every devtool that gets to scale.\n\nthe frustrating part is the dishonesty. just tell us you're running a cheaper model. let us opt into \"fast but expensive\" vs \"slow but cheap\" modes. don't gaslight users into thinking nothings changed when the difference is obvious to anyone who has used it consistently.\n\nanyway i'm probably switching back to claude code or trying out factory, when i've tested these recently they both did seem better. \n\nanyone tracked performance degradation quantitatively or is this just anecdotal?

As well, I set up commands (/ commands) using .md files in Claude using that AgentOS thing and SuperClaude as well.

I built this","selftext":"I started using Cursor almost a year ago, then in July I used Claude Code, and in August I started with Codex. IDEs like VS Code/Cursor were designed as code editors. Then AI became a helper‚Ä¶ but now we've reached a point where AI is the main driver and we only edit bits of code here and there. That's a new paradigm and not how IDEs were originally designed.¬†\n\nI agree IDEs are more user-friendly, but the flexibility of the terminal gives you real freedom. I tried tmux and it's great for managing multiple terminals, but it's not specifically designed for coding, so I missed many VS Code/Cursor features.\n\nSo I thought: what if I build an app that takes the best of both worlds: UI and capabilities of an IDE, but designed for AI-driven coding?\n\nI've been using it for a week and it's seriously improved my productivity ([see my GitHub profile](https://github.com/miguelpieras)).

Fast-forward to now. I reached a point in an advanced custom OCR annotation platform where I hit a wall and decided to give codex a try. It knocked out the blocker effortlessly. I then hit another wall and consulted Codex again. No problems, no snags, no handholding.\n\nWhat really astounds me with Codex compared to Claude is its ability to \"get shit done\". Though I don't recommend it, I can give it a vague task and in the end, it's usually puts together what I was looking for. There's no handholding or micromanaging. Nothing's lost in translation. More and more I actually find it better to not be so stringent and letting it dictate that path of my vision.\n\nOriginally I liked the fact that I could bootstrap and get results fast with Claude but in the end my code quality suffered.

Also, the context percentage shows continually so you can choose when you want to wrap up your work and compact or reset on your terms instead of being surprised \n\nBecause token burn increases the longer the context. So you can do short little jobs and keep resetting. If you're getting a lot of good work done, you can keep going your choice \n\nIt has an extension. Isn't as granular as the CLI but you can make a plan and get a lot of things done first. Just know that it uses more token burn because it does more stuff whether you want it to or not \n\n\nThe third item is codex web and depending on how many jobs and what you're doing in the codex extension, you can send those jobs to the codex web and get them back later. You can't change the model. It keeps the 03 model but it's not bad for low end work like linting or refactoring small things so you don't have to burn all your context doing every single little thing \n\nIf you're using the CLI full-time on one project as in a full day of not stopping from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. you can get about 2 days or 2 and 1/2 days before you get the reset warning for the week and that is 5 days. \n\nThat's on the plus account. Depending on how much you use, you might want a second account. The business account (renamed from teams) is 30 per account and does not give you additional token use. It only gives you shared workspace. \n\nSo depending on how much you use it, three accounts for 60 make more sense. When one of your accounts taps out all you do is type codex logout and then log back in with your other account. \n\nThat does mean the CLI has to close. So when you feel like you're getting close you should start saving more often. When I get surprised, I will copy the last page out into a separate window called context. Then when I reload a fresh window, I will just give the path to it and say check the existing body of work against the last context here and start and that usually works","score":19,"author":"FarVision5","created":1758596663},{"id":"nfqj67v","parentId":"nfpilah","postId":"1no3xr9","depth":1,"text":"They are all using GTP5, and codex web is using GPT-5-codex now.

It sounds like you're running into some pretty common limitations with Codex when it comes to executing commands and accessing the file system. Here are a few thoughts that might help you troubleshoot and potentially work around these issues.\n\n1. **MCPs and Shell Access**: Codex is indeed a bit more restrictive compared to Claude when it comes to executing shell commands and interacting with the file system. It‚Äôs designed with a focus on safety and security, which can limit its ability to run inline commands or access the file system directly. If you want to enable more flexibility, consider using a wrapper around Codex that can handle these interactions separately. This way, you can send commands to the wrapper, which then executes them in a controlled environment.\n\n2. **Permissions and Configuration**: Double-check your environment setup. Make sure that the API keys and permissions are correctly configured to allow Codex to access the resources it needs. Sometimes, the issue can be as simple as a missing permission or an incorrect API endpoint.\n\n3. **Sandboxing Solutions**: If you're looking for a more robust solution, you might want to explore using a platform like Cognitora.dev. They leverage Firecracker microVMs for sub-second startup times and provide hardware-level isolation for agent sandboxes. This could allow you to run Codex in a more flexible environment where you can manage file access and execute shell commands without the typical restrictions.\n\n4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: If you're planning to scale this out or coordinate multiple agents, Cognitora also supports A2A protocols, which can help you manage interactions between different agents more effectively. This could be particularly useful if you want to have Codex work alongside other models or agents.\n\n5. **Persistent File Systems**: With Cognitora, you can also take advantage of persistent file systems, which would allow Codex to read and write files as needed, overcoming the limitations you're currently facing.\n\nIn summary, while Codex has its limitations, there are ways to work around them by adjusting your setup or leveraging platforms that provide more flexibility.

With 8K+ GitHub stars and 400K+ downloads, it's become essential for many developers managing their AI coding budgets.\n\n# What's New in v17.0\n\n**üéØ Multi-Provider Support**\n\n* Track both Claude Code AND OpenAI Codex usage\n* Unified interface for all your AI coding costs\n* Compare usage patterns across different tools\n\n**üì¶ Better Architecture**\n\n* MCP server now in separate package (`@ccusage/mcp`)\n* 40% smaller bundle (1MB ‚Üí 600KB)\n* Ready for upcoming Sonnet 1M token model\n\n**‚ö° Performance**\n\n* 95% faster with Valibot replacing Zod\n* Improved caching analysis\n\n# For Claude Code Users\n\nNothing changes for basic usage:\n\n    npx ccusage@latest daily\n    npx ccusage@latest monthly\n    \n\nIf you're using MCP, update your Claude Desktop config:\n\n    npx u/ccusage/mcp@latest --type http\n    \n\n# For Those Also Using Codex\n\nTrack your Codex usage with:\n\n    npx @ccusage/codex daily\n    bunx @ccusage/codex@latest daily  # ‚ö†Ô∏è @latest required with bunx\n    \n\n# Why This Update Matters\n\nMany of us are using both Claude and OpenAI tools depending on the task. With models getting 1M+ context windows (including the upcoming Sonnet update), having visibility across all your AI tools is crucial. You can now:\n\n* Compare costs between Claude and GPT-5\n* See which tool gives better cache hit rates for your workflow\n* Track total AI coding spend across providers\n\n# Links\n\n* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)\n* **Documentation**: [https://ccusage.com](https://ccusage.com)\n* **Release Notes**: [https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage/releases/tag/v17.0.0](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage/releases/tag/v17.0.0)\n* **Sponsor**: [https://github.com/sponsors/ryoppippi](https://github.com/sponsors/ryoppippi)\n\nThanks to everyone who's been using and contributing to ccusage!

I was unhappy with their web interface, the Webgui, everyone loves so much was too bloated as well so I had Claude code me a chat interface for API. Worked like a charm, had a token counter and other bells and whistles. GUI was really nice. Than I told it to make me a program like a game of life sort of thing. However I wanted it in 3d space with neural nets for each creature and ai overseer and a learning setup with nice graphics, internal creature language and sensory development etc. it took Claude couple days with minimal input about 8k code lines with my input limited to telling it what I didn‚Äôt like and where it needed to go. After that I  had it make a complex script making Linux work smoothly for a novice user as I wasn‚Äôt about to read a Linux Bible and memorize it. Took it 5 hrs. Claude also coded me a proof of concept where data and execution was purely driven by messages and it worked perfect out of the box. I pushed it even farther after that and made another proof of concept where data and execution was encoded as a nodal interference pattern and after some back and forth clarification it done that. Made human language response using primitives encoded into 500k response database that was calculated on the fly in 0.5 seconds ( think about it as a poor man‚Äôs LLM) to jumpstart a parser directing queries to APIs. It done that flawlessly and it guesstimated it to be an equivalent of a 2B LLM in performance. Subsequently it made me a ‚Äúseed‚Äù LLM growing and developing itself slowly. It made it work. After all that it started making a Lisp like language and interpreter without the top down flow using lessons learned from earlier projects.  I was half way through a GUI when Claude got stupid. GPT couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt touch any of those items besides producing some pseudocode and ideas.

I've tried gpt-5 and gpt-5-codex medium and it did a couple of things out of place, even though I stayed on one topic AND was using less than 50% tokens. It duplicated elements on the page (instead of updating them) or deleted entire files instead of editing them, changed certain styles and functionality when I did not ask it to, wiped out data I had stored locally for testing (again I didn't ask it to), and simply took too much time, and also needed me to approve for the session seemingly an endless number of times.\n\nWhile I am not new to using tools (I've used CC and GitHub copilot previously), I recognise CC and Codex are different and will have their own strengths and weaknesses. Claude was impressive (until the recent frustrating limits) and it could tackle significant tasks on its own, and it had days when it would just forget too many things or introduce too many bugs, and other better days.\n\nI am not trying to criticise anyone setup/anything, but I want to learn.

{"postId":"1o4jr3n","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"What ACTUALLY works after testing every AI coding tool for 6 months","selftext":"I've been using AI to code every single day for the past 6 months. Tried everything: Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, RooCode, Coderabbit, Traycer, Continue, ChatPRD, Cline. Some worked great. Most didn't.\n\nAfter burning through hundreds of hours and way too much money on subscriptions, here's what I learned.\n\n# Important stuff\n\n**Tell AI exactly what you want**   \n  \nStop hoping it'll figure things out. Write 1-2 clear sentences about what needs to happen before giving any task. \"Fix the auth bug\" is garbage. \"Fix the JWT refresh token not updating in /src/auth/token.ts line 45\" will actually work.\n\n**Plan before you code**   \n  \nThis changed everything for me. Break everything into specific file-level steps BEFORE writing any code. Most tools give you vague plans like \"update authentication service.\" That's useless. You need \"modify refreshToken() function in /src/auth/token.ts lines 40-60.\" Use tools like Traycer, ChatPRD or even just ChatGPT/Claude to plan out things properly before you start coding.\n\n**Feed small chunks, not whole repos**  \n  \nI noticed everyone dumps their entire codebase into AI. That's why their code breaks. Point to specific files and line numbers. The models lose focus with too much context, even with huge context windows.\n\n**Review everything twice**   \n  \nFirst with your own eyes. Then let an AI reviewer (like Coderabbit) catch what you missed. Sounds paranoid but it's saved me from pushing broken code more times than I can count. Remember to TREAT AI LIKE A JUNIOR DEV. \n\n# The mistakes everyone makes\n\n* Vague prompts give you vague code. \"Make it better\" gives you nothing useful.\n* \"Update the button color\" sounds simple but which button? where? Be specific or watch AI update random stuff across your app.\n* Letting AI pick your tech stack means it'll import random packages from its training data. Tell it EXACTLY what to use.\n* \"It runs\" doesn't mean it works. I learned this the hard way multiple times.\n\n# My actual workflow\n\n**Planning** \n\nI tried Windsurf's planning mode, Claude Code's planning, Traycer's planner. Only Traycer gives actual file-level detail with parallel execution paths. The others just list high-level steps you already know.\n\nFor complex planning, the expensive models work best but for most daily work, the standard models are fine when you structure the prompts right.\n\n**Coding** \n\nCursor was great until their pricing went crazy. Claude Code is my go-to now, especially after proper planning. Windsurf and Cline work too but honestly, once you have a solid plan, they all perform similarly. I'm hearing a lot of great things about Codex too but haven't tried it out yet.\n\nThe newest Gemini models are decent for simple stuff but can't compete with Anthropic's latest models for complex code.\n\n**Review** \n\nThis is where most people mess up. You NEED code review. CodeRabbit catches issues I miss, suggests optimizations, and actually understands context across files. Works great on PRs if your team's cool with it, or just use their IDE extension if not.\n\nTraycer's file-level review is good for checking specific changes. Cursor's review features exist but aren't worth the price increase.\n\nTLDR;\n\n* Be super specific with AI prompts by naming exact files, functions, and line numbers instead of vague requests\n* Plan everything in detail first before writing any code\n* Feed AI small chunks of specific files rather than dumping your entire codebase\n* Always double-check your code yourself then use AI reviewers to catch missed issues\n\n","score":287,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4jr3n/what_actually_works_after_testing_every_ai_coding/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4jr3n/what_actually_works_after_testing_every_ai_coding/","author":"notdl","created":1760257714,"numComments":97,"comments":[{"id":"nj30rck","parentId":null,"postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":0,"text":"Summary:\nAfter testing every major AI coding tool for 6 months, the key takeaways are:\n\nBe extremely specific with prompts (mention exact files, functions, and lines).\n\nAlways plan detailed file-level steps before coding.\n\nGive AI small, focused chunks - not your whole repo.\n\nReview code twice: yourself first, then with an AI reviewer.\nBest combo: Traycer for planning, Claude Code for coding, and CodeRabbit for reviews.","score":85,"author":"codestormer","created":1760266161},{"id":"nj3j3xy","parentId":"nj30rck","postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":1,"text":"Summary Summary:\nBe ultra-specific in prompts, plan steps at the file level, feed AI small chunks, and double-review the code (you first, then AI).

People who don't want to do any configuration and just want something that just works - that's Codex right now. \n\nClaude code needs customization. Very powerful but the default philosophy of the tool is bare bones. Part of that is a strategy. It didn't need very much tooling and did very well on benchmarks, but one of the things about those benchmarks is it wasn't very efficient while doing it. It's no surprise to me that Anthropic was one of the earliest proponents of the model context protocol, because Claude code needs to be extended by tools and hooks. \n\nHowever, recently, after lagging behind the front-runners for a long time, GitHub Copilot is making a solid comeback. An absolute underrated dark horse is Grok Coder Fast in github Copilot. \n\nI think part of why it perhaps has flown under the radar is that it's not as big-picture as either Sonnet or ChatGPT-5. You absolutely need to either be actively involved in making the initial plan (which is hardly the point of agentic coding). But if you have the very first turn where you make a plan be one of the more capable models, Grok Coder Fast absolutely crushes the execution. \n\n\nI used to like to say that Claude's strength wasn't in being the best coder, but the best worker. Sonnet had a lot of early success because it was very persistent. The peak of what I meant was around the Sonnet 3.5 era, where comparing it to the other models of the time (like the GPT variants) which would give up at the drop of a hat, Claude would soldier on. I think that's still true to an extent, but the latest iteration of ChatGPT-5 has made that advantage less valuable, and I find that Claude's over-eagerness, while toned down in 4.5, isn't enough of an advantage anymore. \n\n\nGrok Coder Fast though knows how to code, and as a persistent worker, it just needs to be paired with a dedicated reasoner to keep it pointed in the right direction and remind it to consider the bigger picture. \n\nThe most satisfying coding tool for me at this point is Kilo Code with specialized agent roles. I feel like the specialized agent thing is often undersold because half of the time when people mean a specialized agent, they just mean the same exact model but with a different set of prompts. People are often too lazy to even customize the tooling available to each sub-agent, so it's really just the same model with a different coat of paint on it. \n\n\nI'd implore everybody, especially anyone who hasn't tried a multi-agent system that actually works, to pick up Kilo Code and understand how vital the separation of roles with clean context passing between them and automatic delegation between them. That's the other piece that's missing. Nobody wants to be clicking and selecting different modes on their agents all the time. \n\nWhat I do is I expressly prompt the Kilo code orchestrator to have their architect make a plan to execute the whatever task I've assigned it. More importantly than that, I order the orchestrator to only delegate 3-4 steps of a task to the coding agent for execution at a time, and then have it pass back to the orchestrator to pass to a reviewing agent to check the others' work immediately. \n\nThis sort of atomic delegation is exactly the workflow that you have to do in cloud code with the plan execute loop. But the agent handles it that itself automatically. And not only that, unlike in plan mode, it clears and gives a clean set of instructions to the new agent. And not only that, a clean set of instructions for each subtask and a clean set of instructions for each reviewer. \n\n\nThe magic that emerges from that is that you can and should use much faster agents on the execution and review portion because they can move quickly. Most of the time, those agents write excellent code, and where they haven't written excellent code, I sure hope that you put in your prompt that the architect should have written snippets that cover all of the important pain points during writing the entire plan. \n\nAnd that's what you get at the end: you get code designed by the smartest model executed by a fast model, so you can do quick iteration that comes pre-reviewed, so you don't have to copy and paste and switch between your tools. It's all executed in a nice bow, and you don't get things like Sonnet's tendency in Claude Code to write some ridiculous summary about what it did because the agent in charge is the orchestrator who you can prompt independently to be pretty sedate.\n\nI'm a firm believer that the only reason we haven't seen this workflow become more prevalent and dominant is that it's a nightmare to quantitatively get quality metrics and improve on it. Instead of having to optimize just one set of prompts and tooling for a consistent experience for your customers, now you've got to optimize a whole team. And you can see as with the Claude experience, most people do not care enough to customize their tools and will not get enough mileage out of this. \n\nWe'll see large-scale adoption of this workflow at some point when the models are tuned enough to dynamically rewrite the prompts of the entire team, and that's become just a common place practice. P.S. This is just how GPT Pro and Grok Heavy work anyway.","score":5,"author":"Coldaine","created":1760285069},{"id":"nj5jct5","parentId":"nj4dpp4","postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":4,"text":"I've tried the orchestrator route a few times, and it generally devolves to noise pretty quickly. Even the smartest models devolve to noise if you give them a long enough leash and a complex enough problem, and relying on a model to plan for you and then hand problems over to a less competent model just does not seem that effective to me.\n\nLike I fired up codex for the first time in a while, just trying to get something done but had a rough night so too tired to do it myself, writing some tests and modifying one class to make it more testable, copy/pasting the new code into the chatGPT project I'm using to talk through the project which has all the context and having it do code review, then going until all the tests look reasonable and all are passing, then I make a PR and do my own code review.\n\nI had a layout class that it could use to understand the expected schema; instead of adding a field to the layout, it made a local layout copy nested inside of the class it was working on. but it wasn't even supposed to use the layout class; it was supposed to just update a different field. So it used the wrong class, but on top of that, it copied it and now there are 2 different layouts which have different structures.\n\nEven still, you can write programs that mostly work, and just keep churning tokens for new features and only drop in when it gets really stuck which is getting rarer and rarer today. But it might end up just looking correct, but being totally wrong when you dig deeper.

{"postId":"1o4ir16","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Vibe Coding and the Popularization of CLI Interfaces: Why Don‚Äôt Big Companies Use Millions of Users as Contributors to Improve Models?","selftext":"I‚Äôd like to share some thoughts and ask a question.\n\nRecently, tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and other AI-based code generation CLI interfaces have become very popular -  their audience is around 15 million users worldwide. Together, these services generate over two trillion tokens per month.\n\nHowever, one thing puzzles me. We all know that even the most advanced AI models are imperfect and often cannot unambiguously and correctly execute even simple coding instructions. So why don‚Äôt big companies : OpenAI, Anthropic, and others -use this huge pool of users as live contributors and testers? Logically, this could significantly improve the quality of the models.\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm missing something, but I reason like this: the user sends a request, and if the result satisfies them, they move on to the next one. If the model makes a mistake, the user provides feedback, and based on that, improvements and further training of the model are initiated. This continuous cycle could become an excellent real-time data collection system for training models.\n\nYou could even introduce some incentive system, like subscription discounts for those who agree to participate in such feedback. Those who don‚Äôt want to participate would pay a bit more for a ‚Äúsilent‚Äù subscription without feedback.\n\nIt seems like a fairly simple and effective way to massively improve AI tools, but from my perspective, it‚Äôs strange that such an idea hasn‚Äôt been clearly implemented yet.

Definitely had some rough edges back then but these days it just keeps getting better. I like to use GPT Codex for generating plan documents and then I use Cheetah or another fast model for writing the code.\n2. [Zed](https://zed.dev/). I use Zed as my terminal because the Cursor/VSCode terminal sucks. I sometimes run Claude Code inside Zed, they have a nice UX on top of Claude Code. I also use Zed whenever I want to edit code by hand because it's a way smoother experience.\n3. [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop). When you generate a ton of code with AI, it's important to keep good hygiene with version control and have a nice UI for reviewing code changes. Github Desktop is my first line of defense when it comes to review.\n4. [Claude Code Github Action](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions). I prefer this to tools like CodeRabbit because it just a Github Workflow and it's easy to customize the way Claude Code runs to generate the review.\n5. [Zo Computer](https://www.zo.computer/).

It's an underrated tool that ties back in heavily to the thing about the context getting polluted with an inaccurate assumption or conclusion that permanently compromises the conversation from that point forward.

Also - there can be qwenCLI added on top of that (but not really necessary even with GLM lite plan being cheapest one) if more sustainability is needed - but I didn't felt that as much needed recently as a few weeks ago. This post's idea (main one) is to share my thoughts after a few hundred thousand vibecoded code lines + a few real, commercial projects delivered already across my local environment. Nobody knows those projects (except their current owners) are 98-100% vibecoded :) so this stack is reliable more or less. Especially compared to claude max20, GPT PRO plans etc. high-cost options.\n\nA bit of background - I'm a regular 9-5 employee as Head of Quality Assurance, process and engineering (in short words), 10+ years of experience across software dev industry. Been coding using AI since first GPT beta really, heavy AI API user in the past and currently aswell via. my corporate job. Freelancer - vibecoder after hours with successful side hustle based on developing simple software / websites for local businesses for past few months.\n\nI established my go-to setup for vibecoding as:\n\n[zed.dev](http://zed.dev)¬†\\- the IDE being AI native, allowing us to connect any LLM via. api directly. Agent being especially useful for longer tasks, allowing us to easily track what AI is working on right now, pretty nice summaries of what was done etc. Also being lightweight over VSC makes it a big win - but what i found the most interesting that AI agent built in ZED doesn't waste my tokens. Keeps context clean by not adding stuff idiotically on top like all plugins out there do - so you can efficiently use up to 85% of max tokens per LLM - and then agent will prompt you to comapct the conversation and start from summary which is also done in a bit different way than CC and other things do - but in a better way preserving context.  \n[GLM coding plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?cc=fission_glmcode_sub_v1&ic=CUEFJ9ALMX&n=em***k%40gmail.com) \\- being the cheaperst opensource SOTA model, capable of delivering stuff and doing things on the sonnet4 pre-anthropic-problems level. Recently had a few cases where i just left GLM with the bug and let it worked on it's own for like 10 or 15 minutes - it's been quite long, but at the end it resolved the complicated issue without my interference. But what's the most important thing is the coding plan being priced especially good - 3$ per month, with ability to secure the price for full year for 36$ (cheaper with my link) - for 120 prompts per 5h it's a nobrainer deal to have capable model. Maybe not the fastest in the world, but as a solopreneur / freelancer it's a huge win for me. Personally I am on Max plan right now - which basically grants no limits as you'll not be able to spin up enough agents to get through 2400 promtps per 5h. It paid for itself during past weekend as i finished developing some tiny bits of software for my client. Efficiency vs cost ratio here is totally awesome - especially if you're trying to set your own business up or just increase profitability. Me switching from CC max20 plan (over 200euro in my country roughly with all the taxes) to GLM coding plan - even on max - saves me like 70% of my AI tools costs right now. So - more money for me to spend on idiotic stuff :D\n\n[openspec CLI¬†](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)\\- newly released specification driven framework to develop things. Previously i used¬†[traycer.ai](http://traycer.ai)¬†but recently successfully replaced it with openspec CLI. OFC traycer is more powerful - as it has autoreview etc. - but openspec being totally free and easily injected into existing codebase (which can't be really done as for now with Github Speckit sadly) to develop new features is another nobrainer. Early days, i believe it'll get even better, but ability to connect it to any LLM via. zed is awesome - and the output is solid aswell + it's not overcomplex as GH speckit.\n\nClaude Code Cli client - best CLI client to use with GLM coding plan or any other anthropic-compatible endpoint. I prefer¬†[zed.dev](http://zed.dev)¬†bc i like to see what my agent does in detail, but if you're looking for CLI agent - CC is the best still - with any LLM. Crush, opencode and others are there, but they're not capable of doing stuff as CC client does.\n\nGH speckit - perfect for starting a new project, but tricky to be injected into existing, non-speckit started codebase. Doesn't really work with complex codebase - but it's still my goto tool, especially after recent updates to just kick off new projects. Just wrap up proper prompts to start it and it'll wrap everything in a perfect way for pure vibecode development.\n\n","score":20,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nnoh8l/cheap_my_go_to_vibecoding_stack/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nnoh8l/cheap_my_go_to_vibecoding_stack/","author":"Bob5k","created":1758552417,"numComments":20,"comments":[{"id":"nfoys30","parentId":null,"postId":"1nnoh8l","depth":0,"text":"as someone who doesn't know from good code to bad code, how useful is this to someone like me","score":3,"author":"NairbHna","created":1758588577},{"id":"nfpxlwy","parentId":"nfoys30","postId":"1nnoh8l","depth":1,"text":"For the code itself Codex/Claude Code are probably more suitable as a more autonomous agentic tools.\n\nSpeckit may be useful as a more precise alternative to a plan mode - if you are willing to spend time and develop granular requirements.

Here's what I tried and my honest review:\n\n1. [Rork.com](http://rork.com/)¬†\\- I was sceptical, but it became a revelation for me. The best AI no-code app builder for native mobile apps in 2025. Way faster than I expected. All the technical stuff like APIs worked without me having to fix anything. Getting ready for app store submission. The previews loads fast and doesn't break unlike other tools that I tried. The code belongs to you -that's rare these days lol (read below). I think¬†[Rork](http://rork.com/)¬†is also best app builder for beginers or non-tech people\n2. [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)¬†\\- my biggest love. Thanks God it exists. It's a bit harder to get started than with Rork or Replit, but it's totally doable -¬†[this tutorial¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYiuzAsWnHU&t=723s)really helped me get into it (I started from scratch with zero experience, but now my app brings 7k mrr)**.**¬†Use Claude Code after Rork for advanced tweaking. The workflow is: prototype in Rork ‚Üí sync to GitHub ‚Üí iterate in Claude Code ‚Üí import them back to Rork to publish in App Store. Works well together. I'm also experimenting with¬†**parallel coding agents**¬†\\- it's hard to manage but sometimes the outcome is really good. Got inspired by¬†[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lja8k5/the_future_is_now_6_agents_in_parallel/)\n3. [Lovable.ai](http://lovable.ai/)¬†\\- pretty hyped, I mostly used it for website prototyping before, but after¬†[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)¬†I use it less and less. They have good UX, but honestly I can recognize Lovable website designs FROM A MILE AWAY (actually it is all kinda Claude designs right??) and I want something new.¬†**BTW I learn how to fix that, I'll drop a little lifehack at the end**. Plus Lovable can't make mobile apps.\n4. [Replit.com](http://replit.com/)¬†\\-I used Replit for a very long time, but when it came time to scale my product I realised I can't extract the code from Replit. Migration is very painful. So even for prototyping I lost interest - what's the point if I can't get my code out later? So this is why I stopped using Replit: 1) The AI keeps getting dumber with each update. It says it fixed bugs but didn't actually do anything. Having to ask the same thing multiple times is just annoying. 2) It uses fake data for everything instead of real functionality, which drags out projects and burns through credits. I've wasted so much money and time. 3) The pricing is insane now. Paying multiple times more for the same task? I'm done with that nonsense. For apps I realized that prototyping with Rork is much faster and the code belongs to me\n5. [FlutterFlow.com](http://flutterflow.com/)¬†\\- You have to do everything manually, which defeats the point for me. I'd rather let AI make the design choices since it usually does a better job anyway. If you're the type who needs to micromanage every button and color, you'll probably love it for mobile apps\n\nHonestly,¬†**traditional no-code solutions feel outdated to me now that we have AI vibecoding with prompts**.

{"postId":"1nbj2ep","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"$20 Codex/CC plan is better for devs than $200. Change My Mind","selftext":"Saying this as a person who had both $200 plan of Claude Code for months and $200 plan of ChatGPT Pro as soon as Codex was available, I found the $20 plan to be the best for individual developers.\n\n**Why not the $200 plan:** Model has way too much capability. It can do a lot. More than what you can monitor, manage, and carefully prompt. At that point, you go full on \"create a full fledge gazillion dollar app that does everything.\" With a prompt like that and s#$t ton of credits, the model starts with something useful until context rots and it hallucinates. It starts writing stuff you never asked for. Overcorrecting, overanalyzing, overdoing. Writing code, making errors, correcting itself, and the constant loop. This is especially terrible in recent versions of \"You're absolutely right!\" Claude Code.\n\n**Why not the free plan:** You'd then think whatever free plan for Codex/CC/Cursor/etc would suffice? Maybe. Free plan is too limiting. Ask it to do a repetitive task and halfway through something fairly decent you're hitting the usage limit.\n\n**Why $20 plan is the sweet spot:** The $20 plan serves you well. It is enough that you can ask it to create a nice UI on a webpage, create endpoints for your code, ask it to analyze performance issues, or overall code structure. It is just enough that you actually put in the effort to see the code and collaborate with the AI to write something good. It is just enough that you actually architect and write code yourself alongside. It is just enough that you do minor tasks yourself. It is not too excessive that you want to throw 200K lines of code and ask it to make the next trillion dollar app.\n\n**Not saying any of this is your fault.** The AI model should be able to create full app without writing bad code and then overcorrect itself. But it doesn't! And we hate that. After extensive utilization of AI to help accelerate projects, I've found that smaller steps is better than letting the model do its own thing. It's sort of what the whole thing with Agile v/s Waterfall was:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eel34uxrswnf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9213d70c50e33f6e1d65706c32b8957b42fa0a3","score":75,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nbj2ep/20_codexcc_plan_is_better_for_devs_than_200/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nbj2ep/20_codexcc_plan_is_better_for_devs_than_200/","author":"TechnologyTailors","created":1757323515,"numComments":57,"comments":[{"id":"nd21sq6","parentId":null,"postId":"1nbj2ep","depth":0,"text":"Yes.\n\nWithout a doubt ChatGPT codes better than your average junior developer and more.\n\nI would rather have full access to the AI model at my job than to actually hire someone.\n\nAnd that fucking scares me.","score":40,"author":"yubario","created":1757323793},{"id":"nd22k3e","parentId":"nd21sq6","postId":"1nbj2ep","depth":1,"text":"Also way better than outsourcing.

We call those users!\", but I decided to share anyway, as I can't find a GitHub repo and this might be useful to someone out there. The ChatGPT / Codex service also costs a non-trivial amount for most people on non-business plans, so issues like the ones described below can be quite discouraging.\n\n1. It is impossible to log into the extension when running VSCode in docker without manipulating the container (no option for deferred login or anything, just browser callbacks). Same for the CLI. We need an option to use a offline token or something like Claude Code has... Now you have to manually curl the response URL back on the VM or docker container, which does not even work properly for the CLI (there is no confirmation message, you have to re-open the app and the it \"works\")...\n2. Chat history is not preserved at all, refreshing or even moving the chat panel also deletes the current Task / conversation.\n3. The chat and entire VSCode app starts lagging unbearably after about 100 messages. The STOP button becomes unresponsive and the text is rendered at 0.5 TPS... The agent is basically stuck until you reboot the entire VSCode container. Also 100% browser CPU usage!\n4. There is no option to compact or reduce the conversation in the extension... And it does not seem to happen automatically, unless I've missed something.\n5. The built-in update\\_plan tool is borderline useless.... The model overwrites the entire task list with each update, making any plan longer than 10 steps basically unviable. I am honestly disappointed in the lack of effort here. The tool feels like it was vibe coded in 15 minutes by an intern with 0 experience in even basic day-to-day planning activities...\n\nMy personal opinion is that VM support should be a priority, as it's not safe to run any of these tools over bare metal, even with sandboxing and various guardrails.\n\nHas anyone else been dealing with similar problems or is there something wrong with my television set?","score":10,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n3yrbx/first_impressions_of_the_overhauled_codex_ide/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n3yrbx/first_impressions_of_the_overhauled_codex_ide/","author":"Ragecommie","created":1756551635,"numComments":3,"comments":[{"id":"nbh241a","parentId":null,"postId":"1n3yrbx","depth":0,"text":"You can use an offline token for the CLI - look at the directions for headless use (which basically IS vm support).

{"postId":"1n3y2vq","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Setting up MCP in Codex is easy, don‚Äôt let the TOML trip you up","selftext":"Now that Codex CLI & the IDE extension are out and picking up in popularity, let‚Äôs set them up with our favorite MCP servers.\n\nThe thing is, it expects¬†**TOML config**¬†as opposed to the standard¬†**JSON**¬†that we‚Äôve gotten used to, and it might seem confusing.\n\nNo worries ‚Äî it‚Äôs very similar. I‚Äôll show you how to quickly convert it, and share some nuances on the Codex implementation.\n\nIn this example, we‚Äôre just going to add this to your global¬†`~/.codex/config.toml`¬†file, and the good news is that both the IDE extension and CLI read from the same config.\n\nOverall, Codex works very well with MCP servers, the main limitation is that it currently only supports¬†**STDIO MCP servers**. No remote MCP servers (SSE or Streamable HTTP) are supported yet.  \nIn the docs, they do mention using MCP proxy for SSE MCP servers, but that still leaves out¬†**Streamable HTTP servers**, which is the ideal remote implementation IMO.  \nThat being said, they‚Äôre shipping a lot right now that I assume it‚Äôs coming really soon.\n\nBTW I also [recorded a short walkthrough](https://youtu.be/p5_PmnYc5Us) going over this, if you prefer watching over reading.\n\n# Getting started\n\nFirst things first: if you haven‚Äôt downloaded Codex CLI or the Codex extension, you should start with that.  \nHere‚Äôs the NPM command for the CLI:\n\n    npm install -g /codex\n\nYou should be able to find the extension in the respective IDE marketplace, if not you can follow the links from OpenAI‚Äôs developer pages here:¬†[https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide)\n\nGetting into your¬†`config.toml`¬†file is pretty easy:\n\n* In the extension, you can right-click the gear icon and it‚Äôll take you straight to the TOML file.\n* Or you can do it via terminal (first create¬†`.codex`¬†in your root and then the¬†`config.toml`).\n\nEither way, it‚Äôs simple.\n\n# TOML conversion\n\nIt‚Äôs really easy, it all comes down to rearranging the name, command, arguments, and env variable. IMO TOML looks better than JSON, but yeah it‚Äôs annoying that there isn‚Äôt a unified approach.  \nHere‚Äôs the example blank format OpenAI shows in the docs:\n\n    [mcp_servers.server-name]\n    command = \"npx\"\n    args = [\"-y\", \"mcp-server\"]\n    env = { \"API_KEY\" = \"value\" }\n\nSo let‚Äôs make this practical and look at the first MCP I add to all agentic coding tools:¬†**Context7**.\n\nHere‚Äôs the standard JSON format we‚Äôre used to:\n\n    \"Context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@upstash/context7-mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n\nSo it just comes down to a bit of rearranging. Final result in TOML:\n\n    [mcp_servers.Context7]\n    command = \"npx\"\n    args = [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp@latest\"]\n\nAdding environment variables is easy too (covered in [Youtube](https://youtu.be/p5_PmnYc5Us) video).\n\n# Other MCPs I‚Äôve been using in Codex\n\n* Web MCP by Bright Data\n* Playwright by Microsoft\n* Supabase for DB management (keep read-only for prod)\n* Basic Memory for unified memory\n\n# What‚Äôs still missing\n\nBesides the missing remote MCP support, the next feature I want is the ability to toggle on/off both individual servers and individual tools (Claude Code is also missing this).\n\n**What about you guys?**  \nWhich MCPs are you running with Codex?

{"postId":"1mn6lof","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Serena MCP goes Codex","selftext":"Wanted to give a quick update to all Serena users: we now added full Codex CLI support!\n\nWith GPT5 available there, codex is now becoming a useful addition to the developer's toolbox. It still lags behind Claude Code in usability IMO, but hopefully it will become better soon, and maybe Serena can help bridge the gap a bit.\n\nStandard MCPs may not work in Codex, since it's not fully MCP compliant, and some massaging of the tool schema needs to be done. That's why Serena was not working there until today, but now did that massaging.\n\n  \nCheck it out if you want to get the most out of Codex!\n\n[https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex)","score":9,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mn6lof/serena_mcp_goes_codex/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mn6lof/serena_mcp_goes_codex/","author":"Left-Orange2267","created":1754897570,"numComments":3,"comments":[]}
