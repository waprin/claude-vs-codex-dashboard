I am a daily user of codex (web and app, no CLI). I've never tried Claude. At work I have access to GitHub copilot (agent mode), which is the closest to cursor I've been to. So that's the element comparison I have, but in comparison to codex GitHub copilot is a joke so I'll just mention my experience with codex in a few points:\n\n* it understands well what I want, and usually comes back with good solution\n* no need to select files, it will just explore the repository itself\n* quite often a single request is enough to get what I want or need (note: except design, often needs fine-tuning but I found also it to be much better with ui libraries, like shadcn for webapps)\n* codex can run commands out-of-the-box, it will write tests and make sure that everything works well before shipping you the result, which is the most important part that improves the most the result reliability\n* you can create an [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) to give it instructions, in particular on my side it will always run the lint and tests (which are also created \"naturally\" as I add more features via codex) to reduce the possibility of introducing bugs\n* the pricing itself it insanely good as I can use codex without restriction (so far üôÇ) only by paying the $20 subscription. I've been using codex quite intensively (probably 30\\~50 sessions per day)\n* I don't know how Claude Code works, but codex will instantiate a session in a container and do all the work there, so it's not happening on your machine (where it would call the LLM). The fact that it's on another machine allows parallelism. It comes handy when I'm working on multiple projects or when I want it to give me multiple suggestions (especially regarding design, we can select up to 4 parallelised sessions in a single request, and then you can also create multiple requests at same time...)\n* As a side note, sessions usually take 3 to 10min, it's not the fastest tool. But I appreciate the quality of what it delivers as it's usually very good and I prefer to let it work and interact less with it than the opposite. Once I had a very difficult debugging to do (some build not working), it ended working for 57min on it (very uncommon, usually I expect no more than 5-6min), I reviewed its changes and it was really good. If I had to do it myself it would have taken probably 1 or 2 days, and the mental charge it saved me from was so good lol\n* It's not so good for iOS app (and I'm guessing android) development. It will generate interesting result, but I still have to verify manually all the time and fine-tune myself. With sessions that take 3-4 minutes, while it's still useful, I'm sure there are better options out there (Claude code?). But for projects that includes everything (e.g. next.js with api server / ui in a single repository), it has been amazing.\n\nSo all in all, while I can't compare with Claude Code, considering the fixed price and if you are working on a project that can run tests, Codex has been a no-brainer for me (I love having an idea in the toilet, running a quick session and deploying in prod via a GitHub action with high level of confidence, all from my phone and without touching my laptop, what a time to be alive lol).","score":3,"author":"Dizzy-Instruction-37","created":1752378833},{"id":"mwkq9zn","parentId":null,"postId":"1l5rxdq","depth":0,"text":"Opus4 was made to work smoothly with Claude Code bro.","score":2,"author":"Eastern_Ad7674","created":1749341151},{"id":"mwr75tm","parentId":null,"postId":"1l5rxdq","depth":0,"text":"Ive been playing with both for the past 10 days.

Loved it at the time, but feels like at least during part of last month the quality of the model responses degraded. I found myself having to regularly steer Claude into not making changes I didn't actually agree on (yes I use the plan mode, it's highly valuable). Claude also often told me that code was production ready when it wasn't, it either failed to compile or had some kind of flaw that needed addressing.\n\nFound out about a $1 Teams plan offer for ChatGPT so figured it would be a great opportunity to check out Codex CLI and GPT\\_5. Suffice to say it impressed me. I tell it what I want, it just does that. Most tasks I've thrown at it are usually completed and successful in one or two shots. If I'm possibly wrong or there's a reason to debate something first then it usually does so, while Claude would've often said \"you're absolutely right, ...\" - blindly agreeing with me regardless. GPT-5 also makes far less assumptions compared to Claude, regularly replying with open questions if it has any. After it completes a task GPT\\_5 will usually follow up with an idea or suggestion related to what we had done, which I also found useful.\n\nThe biggest challenge I've given it so far was to refactor a long overdue and messy .cs file that contained about 3k LOC. I've tried this with various other AI LLMs, including Claude Code (which couldn't read the entire file as it was over 25k tokens), but they just ultimately make bugs and mess things up when trying to do so. I didn't think GPT-5 would be any different, but my god, it surprised me again. I planned with it, did it in small bits and pieces at a time, and a day or so later I'm now down to around 1k LOC for that file. It seems to be working fine too.\n\nI've been using Claude primarily since Sonnet 3.5, and GPT models before Sonnet 3.5, but it looks like I'm back with OpenAI again unless Anthropic \"wow\" me back.\n\nFor Codex CLI, I would recommend checking out the \"just-every/code\" fork.

It's also ridiculously expensive; I get the same usage on the $20 openai plan that I get on the $200 claude plan, so it's hard to justify using it as a primary tool.\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about codex asking every step; using it on macOS I've never had it ask me to do anything, it just stops often and reports it's progress which seems to be a good balance.

{"postId":"1n6388n","subreddit":"ClaudeAI","title":"Codex Vs Claude: My initial impressions after 6 hours with Codex and months with Claude.","selftext":"I'm not ready to call Codex¬† a \"Claude killer\" just yet, but I'm definitely impressed with what I've seen over the past six hours of use.\n\nI'm currently on Anthropic's $200/month plan (Claude's highest tier) and ChatGPT's $20 plus plan. Since this was my first time trying ChatGPT, I started with the Plus tier to get a feel for it. There is also a $200 pro tier available for Chatgpt\n¬†\nThis past week, Claude has been underperforming significantly, and I'm not alone in noticing this. After seeing many users discuss ChatGPT's coding capabilities, I decided to give Codex a shot, and I was impressed. I had two persistent coding issues that Claude couldn't resolve and ChatGPT fixed both of them easily, in one prompt.¬† There are also a few other things I like about Codex so far. It has Better listening skills. It pays closer attention to my specific requests, it admits mistakes, it collaborates better on troubleshooting by asking clarifying questions about my code, and its response is noticeably quicker than Claude Opus.¬† However, ChatGPT isn't perfect either. I'm currently dealing with a state persistence issue that neither AI has been able to solve. Additionally, since I've only used ChatGPT for six hours, compared to months with Claude, I may have given it tasks it excels at. Bottom line: I'm genuinely impressed with ChatGPT's performance, but I'm not abandoning Claude just yet. However, if you haven't tried ChatGPT for coding, I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot ‚Äì it performed exceptionally well for my specific use cases. It may be that going forward I use both to finish my projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: to install make sure you have node.js installed and your computer then run            \n\nnpm install -g @openai/codex \n\nYou can also install using homebrew by running.\n\nbrew install codex","score":231,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n6388n/codex_vs_claude_my_initial_impressions_after_6/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n6388n/codex_vs_claude_my_initial_impressions_after_6/","author":"Interesting-Back6587","created":1756766976,"numComments":196,"comments":[{"id":"nbx7pmg","parentId":null,"postId":"1n6388n","depth":0,"text":"I tried codex today for the first time.

Once I get the stamp of approval from both AIs, then I deploy. This method has worked pretty well for me so far.

I am more confident and comfortable with CC even with it's crazy quirks and issues ( like the hot-crazy girlfriend -> might be doing some  crazy stuff, but the benefits are worth it). \n\nI use numerous design/spec/todo/test instructions in my .planning folder typically created by CC Opus and I have numerous other ai agent instructions about my project/subsystem/UI design/code patterns in agent agnostic ai-rules folders. I use these files to simply share project context without any mcp servers or other complex system and it works pretty well. I find using Codex for UI design works pretty well and Gemini is very good at code reviews. I get Gemini or Codex to do design/code reviews and ask CC for feedback until I get a good design to implement. Each LLM has their own personalities and quirks and blind spots, but it is a lot like working with really great human engineers who also have those issues. You have to learn how to context engineer each of the LLMs and I find that keeping these little ai-rules .md files really helps. For example:\n\n    database-patterns.md, error-handling.md,logging.md\n    payment-processing.md,playwright-rules.md, \n    prototyping.md, quality-control.md\n    ui-html-standards.md,ui-navigation.md, win-vm-debugging.md\n\nEvery time I get the AI to grok an aspect of my system or design /code pattern, I try to get it to use what it learned to create these ai-rule .md files. I review them, cull them and keep them up to date. I think these files combined with good iterated designs, plans and specs really help the LLMs get things right earlier and with less testing and surprises. (Wait what ?  What do you mean you were simulating the results ? - ha). Context Engineering is the most valuable skill to have and is the critical IP for developing large scale systems.\n\nI am a big fan of the CC interface and I have connected CC- to use gpt-5-reason-high LLM when I hit my rate limits. That allows me to use CC CLI and bypass the block using OpenAI LLMs. \n\nNet-Net: Still prefer CC /opusplan then Codex/GPT-5 and Gemini/gemini-2.5-pro with OpenCode for just checking out what Grok might have to say about things.

You spend 70% of your time babysitting or trying to steer it whereas gpt5 just ‚Äúgets it‚Äù the first or second time and then stays laser focused on that specific thing.\n\nYou do not need hooks or output styles or mcps or these elaborate systems like you do just to babysit Claude and keep it on task and in scope. GPT5 also ACTUALLY pays attention to the AGENTS.md for the ENTIRE context window it‚Äôs a wild concept after months of Claude‚Äôs refusal to do so.","score":5,"author":"buttery_nurple","created":1756658533},{"id":"nbrsnra","parentId":null,"postId":"1n4rvpw","depth":0,"text":"Codex before GPT-5 was extremely slow and shit, so I went to Claude code. \n\nBut now that Claude went to shit, I tried codex again with GPT-5 and it's like night and day of a difference. \n\nMy main issues with claude is:\n\n- it would try to be \"too helpful\", adding things I didn't request, comments on everything like \"// Set width here\" over a variable assignment, junior level comments. \n- Recent buggy behaviour, it would completely ignore my Claude.md file which I found extremely frustrating.\n- If I ever had to escape interrupt to redirect it after I told it to \"think\", instead of continuing to think it would revert back to \"quick helper\" mode. \n- Always reported it completed the work, when it missed most of the tasks. \n- Code quality was extremely poor, even in a small code base. Extremely verbose naming, `react` code conventions regardless of framework I was in. \n- Sub agents doing whatever the fuck they wanted, ignoring their roles I assigned them. At the end I resorted to a \"unit of work\" agent who's instructions were \"Do one task only, do it well\", but no, even those agents always wanted to build my project after code changes to test if it worked.\n\nAt the end of my claude experience I had a slash command `/v` which was `Read the @CLAUDE.md file. Use vue conventions. Deep Think about the task the user is requesting: $ARGUMENTS`. I was relying on bandaids to make their product work. \n\nI figure either I got really unlucky and signed up for claude in the last 2 months after model changes and usage caps were introduced, or all these vibe coders pumping out a multitude of agents and making apps are making code landfills and are not paying attention to the AI slop being generated. \n\n---\n\nOn the other hand my experience with codex has been great though I'm not sure if it's just bias after my poor experience with claude code. Codex will not do extra work unless necessary, and it will always give me suggestions at the end after it's done on what to do next, instead of implementing them without my input. Code quality is better so far, especially in think mode (use `/model`), no \"react by default\" patterns when I'm working in vue/nuxt. Context window is gigantic, no more frequent \"compacting conversation\". No \"Opus usage reached, reverting to dumber model\" - I get what I pay for.

For example, the button for choosing \"do you want to share your data with us\" had a color design that the \"yes\" option used a gray color style which they are otherwise only using for their \"no\"-options... \n\n- They introduced new limits for intense Claude Code users - which is also fair I suppose; but again, they were very vague in describing what those limits are, i.e. \"14-24 hours of usage per week of something\" which is different from their \"X amount of queries\" description they used previously, as in, they went out of their way, by coming up with new terms rather than using existing ones, to *not* communicate what the new limits actually are. While OpenAI is not exactly particularly transparent about some of their limits either, it makes a huge difference whether we are talking about limits that reset every few hours, versus only once per week... and if you reach the weekly limit, the product becomes completely unusable, rather than just one of several options no longer being available (like with OpenAIs deep research, or o3 in the past).\n\nSo, while none of these two changes are particularly bad by themselves, I really do not appreciate the manipulative style in which they are communicated - it makes me suspicious where else they might manipulate me where I would actually mind, yet not notice it... for example: I generally do not really believe those rumors that \"they are secretly downgrading the quality of their models\". But: Their overall behavior indicates that they would likely try it, if they felt they could get away with it somehow, so, I would not exactly rule it out...\n\nAs for the Claude Code software itself, I suppose it is not too bad, but the number of bugs and questionable design decisions is surprisingly long:\n\n- Setting it up on Windows is annoyingly complex.\n\n- Strange scrolling problems in the terminal windows, so that you basically need to restart the software every two hours or so.\n\n- Important information such as the number of tokens in the context are hidden by default, except if you activate \"--verbose\". But, verbose shows too much other irrelevant information... There is also no way of configuring what is shown.\n\n- Horizontally resizing the terminal window can lead to very different, and strange, issues, depending on what terminal you use, what operating system, etc...\n\n- Verbose-mode has another bug, where the stop-hook keeps cluttering the output, so you need to restart the software about every 10 prompts or so.\n\n- Some color schemes are unreadable, as they have almost identical shades of colors for text and background\n\n- Overall, Claude models have a relatively high fraction of downtime (Perplexity even had to completely disable Claude models for a while), and that also affects Claude Code.\n\n- Even though I haven't seen any evidence of regressions of the models itself (except for that one issue recently...), I am fairly certain that Opus has become slower over time (from about 60 token/s to 40 token/s). This is likely just due to Claude Code becoming more popular, and them not keeping up with demand, but, it doesn't change the fact that it is still a way in which the product has become notably worse over time.\n\n- The Claude (non-Code) desktop app seems to crash after ~10 hours or so, so you need to restart it as well. Recently, it also was suddenly no longer resizable.\n\n- Europeans have to pay extra when using Claude Code, because Anthropic fixes the exchange rate at 1 Euro = $1.10, without giving you the option to pay in $ directly (and apparently, there is even some strange geolocking issue going on, where Americans with European bank accounts or Europeans with American bankaccounts are unable to pay at all).\n\n- There is probably much more stuff I don't even remember... \n\nNow, none of those issues are really critical, and OpenAI also has stupid issues (i.e. the ChatGPT desktop software update popup causes issues with fullscreen applications); but still, somehow, the issues of Claude Code (and around Claude Code) come across as a particularly annoying case of \"they are not putting any thought into the design of their product - except for the purpose of manipulating you to your own detriment\".\n\nTo be fair, OpenAI is also annoying with how they keep changing their models all the time, with little announcement time etc... but despite this serious issue, they might still be the overall more reliable alternative...","score":1,"author":"HighDefinist","created":1756686559},{"id":"nbskusj","parentId":null,"postId":"1n4rvpw","depth":0,"text":"how does codex plus $20/m compared with cc 20x, i always use opus to save time (less problem than sonnet)  \n  \nbtw still afraid the gpt5 will break my working codes  \ni still can access gpt5 with zencoder and warp terminal, but not really use them alot, how does it compare with using codex","score":1,"author":"dodyrw","created":1756707251},{"id":"nbsw4lb","parentId":null,"postId":"1n4rvpw","depth":0,"text":"Can I use Codex with GitHub Copilot Pro+?

{"postId":"1nb27dh","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"I've been asking Claude Code and Codex to create the same projects for a couple of days and this is my opinion.","selftext":"Hey!\n\nI'm a frontend developer with 7+ years of experience, and my use of AI in development is basically the Cursor autocomplete.\n\nI've been called a dinosaur for coding more \"by hand\" than with AI, so this weekend I decided to start some projects and ask the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto do everything from scratch, barely touching the code. More like those new \"vibe coders\".\n\nI've been using GPT5-mid and Sonnet 4.\n\nFirst, I asked both of them to implement a feature in a QML + C++ project, a program whose focus is to be used in KDE Plasma and is highly integrated with KDE Frameworks 6.\n\nBoth failed misarabley but this I was already expecting. The documentation for this is terrible and the AI is still very bad working with those stack.\n\nThe, I decided to start a project from scratch. I asked ChatGPT to create a simple documentation from an ideia that I have, then I created a folder with this documentation and duplicated it. One for Codex, one for Claude.\n\nThe application is a simple platform to download free public ebooks that the API gives me.\n\nI create the mockup with Banani and asked both to create the design based on the mockup. Both did it TERRIBLY. It was so bad that I decided to start everything again, but using ShadCN/Vue instead.\n\nFrom nothing to a simple base, Claude went WAY better than Codex because of one thing that I think it's a problem: Claude took freedom to do more things than I asked to. Codex did exactly what I asked and nothing more.\n\nSo, to starting a new project from zero when you have no idea of all the things you need, I think it's okay to Claude have this little freedom because it can give you some nice ideas, but if you have some design and should follow something strictly, I think Codex do it better.\n\nBut, because of that, you have to ask Codex to do everything, step by step for you. This is the way Codex works better and is a way I liked (I don't like to have the AI doing a massive number of changes at once).\n\nBoth created a good code, a good structure and both messed with UI.\n\nClaude did a better job by creating small components and separating everything. Codex did everything in the App.vue and I had to ask it to split the components and pages.\n\nIt was a simple project, the code was simple and both did well. I ended finishing the project with Codex because I wanted to test it more (because I tested Claude before with another project).\n\nToday I started the second project, a game with Godot 4. Well, Claude did everything I asked and everything was working since the beginning. The moment it finished the first command,  I opened Godot 4, hit play and everything went well. I asked him to do a lot of thing and it never failed, it never gave me any error.\n\nCodex, on the other end... After the first command, I opened Godot, hit play and received and error. Asked to fixed, and it fixed. Asked to do another thing, hit play again, another error, asked to fixed, then another error, asked to fixed, then all good. Then ask another thing, hit play, then two errors appeared, asked to fixed, then seven errors appeared... I gave up and finished my game with Claude.\n\nAbout the context window. Codex never went bellow 50%, with Claude I had to run the /compact command once.\n\nI have the 20 euros plan on both and still working fine even coding for 12+ hours on this weekend.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that if one of you starts a project poorly, it will only get worse and worse and deliver something bad.

So I took it upon myself to try them both because I am also curious.\n\nI have Claude Pro and ChatGPT Plus. I used Sonnet 4 and GPT5 Codex Medium. I am mostly a vibe coder, I know python well but it's not my main focus at work so I am slow to write code but I know what i'm looking for and if what the model is doing makes sense.\n\nIn my short time with Codex I notice it is much slower, much more verbose, and overly complicates things.\n\nI asked it to make a simple Python app that can extract text from PDFs and it makes a very complicated folder structure and tries to make a second venv, despite already having one set up from pycharm. I ended up helping it along but it make a terribly complicated project that technically does work. I did specify \"use a concise style\" and \"project should be as simple as possible\"\n\nCodex gives you a lot more usage but the tokens are wasted on a lot of thinking and a lot of unnecessary work.\n\nClaude Code on the other hand, if I give it the same starting prompt is a lot more organized. It updates [claude.md](http://claude.md) with its milestones and automatically goes into planning mode. The folder structure it makes for the project is very logical and not bloated. Also when claude is done, **it always tells you exactly what it's done and how to use and run what its wrote.** This seems logical, but with Codex it would just say 'okay done' and not tell what how to use the arguments for the script it made. \n\nI do think you get less for your money with Claude, the limit is reached a lot quicker but quality over quantity here. Overall, i'll stick for Claude Code, it's not perfect but it's much easier to rely on.\n\nPrompt used:\n\n`Let's plan a project.

I also don't run any MCPs or have any complex workflows around AI and so on. Whatever AI, I don't let it do any git actions, and neither build/test/etc commands, unless explicitly requested. So, it's either refactoring, i.e. reducing duplicated code, extracting that into reusable components, or looking into what can be or should be extracted into a composable, debugging errors, scaffolding new features, documentation, that sort of thing. In Next.js projects what I've struggled most with with Claude Code is that it did not follow documentation or the patterns, did not use existing reusable components or compostables, kept messing up server side with client-side, in one project with Supabase, kept suggesting I hardcode the service key... I tell it, forget service key exists, and it does it again. So, you have to be very vigilant what and how it does, and yeah, it's somehow quite difficult to get it do what you asked it to do lately, even with clear instructions, docs, and claude.md. For example, the data layers and structure doc, I referenced it Claude.md, MUST BE FOLLOWED, I attach it to every request when it's relevant, explain to use the examples and the structure laid out in that document, and it doesn't doesn't do it, even after I stop it and tell again to read the file again, plan again. It plans, all sounds good, it starts implementing and halfway it's back again at completely messing everything up.  Lately it started, as I've said before, just creating random functions and imports, that service key thing was its way of \"solving\" authentication bug.... Or it halfway does refactoring, then ends with, \"All done, ready to be implemented\". And by that it meant, 'I've taken out this bit, added some non-existing functions, left the duplicated code in, added non-existent imports into the original component. Removed working functions that were irrelevant to the refactoring, because why not. You're welcome.'\n\nWith Codex, and again, I've just tried it out today, so I can't say much about long-term use, it's been pretty straightforward and easy. /init, it went through the codebase and created [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md), which was pretty damn accurate from the get-go, it somehow even identified that data layers and architecture doc as the patterns and structure to be followed (which it did, without me even saying it should like I have to repeatedly with Claude), I just had to tweak some things to make sure that git stuff and any commands are off limits. It did follow everything in the agents md file, so I did not need to add any further instructions on how things should be done. It got the structure, the localisation, before creating any components it checked for what can be reused that's already there, and so on, without me asking, did not mess up server-side and client-side, etc. I had a Sentry initialisation bug, which we solved pretty quickly, and developed more data privacy related features along the way. Then did some refactoring, copy/localisation tweaks, UI enhancements, etc. That was just a breeze in comparison to Claude. And I was really surprised not to have hit any limits at all, before I started a new session for whatever we were working on, the context window was still over 70%, with Claude I'd be done halfway Sentry bug along because of the constant back and forth. And when starting a new session with Codex, all I had to do is say, this is the component, we need to do x, y, z, and it did it without me explaining again and again about the structure and the patterns and expected outcomes. The only irritating thing was, I changed the styling of a badge, and it kept reverting it back, don't know why. But other than that, no issues so far. But then again, my workflow is pretty basic and straightforward.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know if it will be improvement for you because I don't know how you work and what you need. For me, I think the following works: Junie (running on Claude) for in-depth documentation, planning, reviews, unit testing, maybe mapping out some complex features, performance optimisation. Codex seems to be pretty good at a lot of things, so rather versatile, and it's very concise and dry in comparison to Claude, which I rather prefer when coding, follows the md file quite well, makes some solid suggestions. Claude Code... I don't know, haven't used it much recently due to the issues and the limits. \n\nMaybe just get ChatGPT Plus for a month, test it out, see how it compares, what works for you.","score":1,"author":"roqu3ntin","created":1757544964},{"id":"ndlw3lr","parentId":"ndi3x1d","postId":"1ndhtaj","depth":1,"text":"That‚Äôs my experience too.\n\nCodex figures out the implied part of the request very well.\n\nAlso doesn‚Äôt have to correct itself as much as CC does.","score":1,"author":"Nizurai","created":1757584406},{"id":"ndgw2if","parentId":null,"postId":"1ndhtaj","depth":0,"text":"Yes, it's completely worth it.

It can also use your ChatGPT subscription now and I've been getting a ton of usage out of my Plus tier. Even with Sonnet, Claude Pro would have limited me LONG ago.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n* While I still prefer CC + Opus 4.1 overall, I actually prefer the code that Codex CLI + GPT-5 writes. It's closer to the code I'd also write.\n* I've used CC over Bedrock and Vertex for work and the rate limits were getting really ridiculous. Not sure this also happens with the Anthropic API, but it's really refreshing how quick and stable GPT-5 performs over Codex CLI.\n* As of today Claude Code is a much more feature rich and complete tool compared to Codex. I miss quite a few things coming from CC, but core functionality is there and works well.\n* GPT-5 seems to have a very clear edge on debugging.\n* GPT-5 finds errors/bugs while working on something else, which I haven't noticed this strongly with Claude.\n* Codex CLI now also supports MCP, although support for image inputs doesn't seem to work.\n* Codex doesn't ship with fetch or search, so be sure to add those via MCP. I'm using my [own](https://github.com/pietz/mcp-web-tools)\n* If your budget ends at $20 per month, I think ChatGPT might be the best value for your money\n\n  \nWhat's your experience?","score":191,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mtk2d9/a_few_thoughts_on_codex_cli_vs_claude_code/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mtk2d9/a_few_thoughts_on_codex_cli_vs_claude_code/","author":"gopietz","created":1755518582,"numComments":127,"comments":[{"id":"n9c42uo","parentId":null,"postId":"1mtk2d9","depth":0,"text":"Thanks for sharing this.

Does the five hour clock start at the beginning of your coding session or the end? I haven't been able to figure that out, but my rough estimation of when I started/stopped coding seemed to land somewhere in the middle. Longer than 5 hours after starting coding, but less than 5 hours after hitting the limit.\n\nAfter hitting the rate limit about 4 hours into working my access was restored around 3 hours later. That would be around 7 hours after I started coding. However, when my access was restored I was only able to fire off a handful of messages before getting rate limited again. In less than 30 minutes, and that's perhaps generous. There are also no warnings ahead of time that you are about to be cut off, making it difficult for you to have the LLM do a summary/progress dump into a file to make it easier to pick it up later or with another agent.\n\nSafe to say this doesn't seem to be a reliable solution for anybody working on anything serious.

{"postId":"1ml565b","subreddit":"ClaudeAI","title":"24 Hours with Claude Code (Opus 4.1) vs Codex (GPT-5)","selftext":"Been testing both for a full day now, and I've got some thoughts. Also want to make sure I'm not going crazy.\n\nLook, maybe I'm biased because I'm used to it, but Claude Code just *feels* right in my terminal. I actually prefer it over the Claude desktop app most of the time bc of the granular control. Want to crank up thinking? Use \"ultrathink\"? Need agents? Just ask.\n\nNow, GPT-5. Man, I had HIGH hopes. OpenAI's marketing this as the \"best coding model\" and I was expecting that same mind-blown feeling I got when Claude Code (Opus 4) first dropped. But honestly? Not even close. And yes, before anyone asks, I'm using GPT-5 on Medium as a Plus user, so maybe the heavy thinking version is much different (though I doubt it).\n\nWhat's really got me scratching my head is seeing the Cursor CEO singing its praises. Like, am I using it wrong? Is GPT-5 somehow way better in Cursor than in Codex CLI? Because with Claude, the experience is much better in Claude code vs cursor imo (why I don't use cursor anymore)\n\nThe Torture Test: My go-to new model test is having them build complex 3D renders from scratch. After Opus 4.1 was released, I had Claude Code tackle a biochemical mechanism visualization with multiple organelles, proteins, substrates, the whole nine yards. Claude picked Vite + Three.js + GSAP, and while it didn't one-shot it (they never do), I got damn close to a viable animation in a single day. That's impressive, especially considering the little effort I intentionally put forth.\n\nSo naturally, I thought I'd let GPT-5 take a crack at fixing some lingering bugs. Key word: *thought*.\n\nNot only could it NOT fix them, it actively broke working parts of the code. Features it claimed to implement? Either missing or broken. I specifically prompted Codex to carefully read the files, understand the existing architecture, and exercise caution. The kind of instructions that would have Claude treating my code like fine china. GPT-5? Went full bull in a china shop.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've seen Claude break things too. But after extensive testing across different scenarios, here's my take:\n\n* Simple stuff (basic features, bug fixes): GPT-5 holds its own\n* Complex from-scratch projects: Claude by a mile\n* Understanding existing codebases: Claude handles context better (it always been like this)\n\nI'm continuing to test GPT-5 in various scenarios, but right now I can't confidently build anything complex from scratch with it.\n\nCurious what everyone else's experience has been.

It also actively communicates with you and reasons in process. Says outright exactly WHAT he is going to do and HOW.

Started looking around for alternatives last week and stumbled across Synthetic.Did some testing between the two. Claude Pro gives you one model for $200, while Synthetic gives you access to 19 different models for $60. The rate limits are actually higher too - I get 1,350 messages every 5 hours vs Claude's monthly caps.\n\nWhat caught my attention was the model variety. They have DeepSeek R1 for reasoning, multiple Qwen variants including the 480B Coder model, GLM-4.5, and newer Llama models like the 4-Maverick with 524k context. The models run at full precision rather than being quantized, which makes a noticeable difference in output quality.\nI use Aider and similar coding tools, and the flat pricing means I don't stress about token costs when refactoring large codebases. Fine-tuning and embeddings are included at no extra cost. You can also use these models with Claude Code through the Claude Code Router, which acts as a proxy to route API calls between providers.\n\nThe subscription works with pretty much any OpenAI-compatible framework - Cline, Aider, Roo, KiloCode, and their own Octofriend terminal agent. Also works with standard LLM clients like OpenWebUI.\nOne advantage over something like OpenRouter is reliability. A lot of OpenRouter backends serve broken or heavily modified versions of these models. Synthetic tests their implementations against coding agents to ensure they work properly - apparently there's a 10 percentage point difference in task completion between official Qwen3 Coder and OpenRouter's versions.\n\nNot saying it's perfect - the UI feels bare bones compared to Claude's interface. But functionally it does what I need for development work.\n\nRouter repo: https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router\n\nSynthetic: https://synthetic.new/?referral=9oxapskWLeOrDT5 (referral link)\n\nFull model list includes DeepSeek R1/V3 variants, Llama 3.1/4 series, Qwen2.5/3 Coder models, Kimi K2, GLM-4.5, and GPT-OSS-120B - all with varying context lengths from 32k to 524k tokens.","score":4,"author":"pixiedustnomore","created":1757154115},{"id":"ncqo41a","parentId":"ncpkyhe","postId":"1n9pxsh","depth":1,"text":"I‚Äôm intrigued.

But I'm the founder of Synthetic so I'll shill my company for a sec lol).\n\nIn my experience GLM-4.5 is usually on par with Sonnet for day-to-day coding. Sometimes Sonnet is a little more intelligent, but sometimes GLM is, and I find GLM to be a little more \"honest\" in the sense that it doesn't tend to do things like rewrite failing tests to spuriously pass instead of fixing the bug that the test is revealing. Although each model seems to be better at slightly different problems, so sometimes getting new eyes on it helps.\n\nGLM-4.5 is also usually a lot faster on Synthetic than Claude 4 Sonnet ‚Äî from my place in Berkeley, California I usually get \\~150 tokens/second. YMMV depending on geography/ISP but most people get well over 100 tps and I've talked to a couple people who somehow are getting 200+ (seems like a rare good combo of geography+ISP though, I'd mostly assume in the 120-170 range).\n\nI don't think there's anything \\*quite\\* at the level of Opus 4.1 (although Anthropic's Opus rate limits are super low IME). I usually use GLM-4.5 as a daily driver, and swap to Opus relatively rarely for tricky problems.\n\nMy personal preference for open-source models is mostly:\n\nGLM-4.5 > Qwen3 Coder 480B > Kimi K2 (original version)\n\nWe just added Kimi K2 0905 ‚Äî it seems like it's a pretty strong model, and I might update my personal preferences, but I haven't used it enough for day-to-day coding yet to know whether it beats GLM-4.5 on a regular basis.

And - also important - i'm using an EXISTING codebase (brown-field). So who wins?\n\nIn the beginning i was fascinated by Codex with GPT-5 Medium: fast and so \"effortless\"! Much faster than CC for the same task (e.g. creating stories, validating, risk assessment, test design) Both made more or less the same observations, but GPT-5 is a bit more to the point and the questions it asks me seem more \"engaging\" Until the story design was done, i would have said: advantage Codex! Fast and really nice resulting documents. Then i **let Codex do the actual coding.** Again it was fast. The generated code (i did only overlook it) looked ok, minimal, as i would have hoped. But... and here it starts.... Some unit tests failed (they never did when CC finished the dev task) Integration tests failed entirely. (ok, same with CC) Codex's fixes where... hm, not so good... weird if statements just to make the test case working, double-implementation (e.g. sync & async variant, violating the rules!) and so on. At this point, i asked CC to make a review of the code created and ... oh boy... that was bad... Used SQL Text where a clear rule is to NEVER used direct SQL queries. Did not inherit from Base-Classes even though all other similar components do. Did not follow schema in general in some cases. I then had CC FIX this code and it did really well. It found the reason, why the integration tests fail and fixed it in the second attempt (first attempt, it made it like Codex and implemented a solution that was good for the test but not for the code quality). So my conclusion is: i STAY with CC even though it might be slightly dumber than usual these days. I say \"dumber than usual\" because those tools are by no means CODING GODS. You need to spend hours and hours in finding a process and tools that make it work REASONABLY ok. My current stack:\n\n* Methodology: BMAD\n* MCPs: Context7, Exa, Playwright & Firecrawl\n* ... plus some own agents & commands for integration with code repository and some \"personal workflows\"\n\n**--- DETAILED UPDATE (Sept 15th, 2025) ---**\n\nFirst off, a huge thank you to everyone who commented on the original post. Your feedback was invaluable and pushed me to dig deeper and re-evaluate my setup, which led to this complete reversal.\n\nThe main catalyst for this update was getting consistent access to and testing with the **GPT-5 High** model. It's not just an incremental improvement; it feels like a different class of tool entirely.\n\n**Addressing My Original Issues with GPT-5 High:**\n\n* **Failed Tests & Weird Fixes:** Gone. With GPT-5 High, the code it produces is on another level. It consistently passes unit tests and respects the architectural rules (inheriting from base classes, using the ORM correctly) that the Medium model struggled with. The \"weird fixes\" are gone; instead of hacky `if` statements, I'm getting logical, clean solutions.\n* **Architectural Violations (SQL, Base Classes):** This is where the difference is most stark. The High model seems to have a much deeper understanding of the existing brown-field codebase. It correctly identifies and uses base classes, adheres to the rule of never using direct SQL, and follows the established schema without deviation.\n\n**The Hybrid Approach: The Best of Both Worlds**\n\nHere's the most interesting part, inspired by some of your comments about using the right tool for the job. I've found that a **mixture of GPT-5 High and Medium renders truly awesome results.**\n\nMy new workflow is now a hybrid:\n\n1. **For Speed & Documentation (Story Design, Risk Assessment, etc.):** I still use **GPT-5 Medium**. It's incredibly fast, cost-effective, and more than \"intelligent\" enough for these upfront, less code-intensive tasks.\n2. **For Precision & Core Coding (Implementation, Reviews, Fixes):** I switch to **GPT-5 High**. This is where its superior reasoning and deep context understanding are non-negotiable. It produces the clean, maintainable, and correct code that the Medium model couldn't.\n\n**New Conclusion:**\n\nSo, my conclusion has completely flipped. For mission-critical coding and ensuring architectural integrity, **Codex powered by GPT-5 High is now my clear winner.** The combination of a structured BMAD process with a hybrid Medium/High model approach is yielding fantastic results that now surpass what I was getting with Claude Code.\n\nThanks again to this community for the push to re-evaluate. It's a perfect example of how fast this space is moving and how important it is to keep testing!","score":39,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n79qvq/claude_code_versus_codex_with_bmad/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n79qvq/claude_code_versus_codex_with_bmad/","author":"zueriwester76","created":1756890104,"numComments":41,"comments":[{"id":"nc6pj6z","parentId":null,"postId":"1n79qvq","depth":0,"text":"Who use medium?

I asked it to include a given parameter on one of those email template methods. It instead of just adding the extra parameter, it injected another service in it to then pull the information, which probably the Junior dev would do without considering existing code standards. Another thing that really bothered me was the habit of leaving comments in places of things I asked to remove. For example \"Hey remove this user assignment on this class\". It would remove but leave a comment // Removed the user assignment from here because we dont need it. WTH.

Use #yolo mode and for example tell the Scrum Master to draft ALL stories of an epic at one. Same for the developer, he can develop all stories sequeniall or you spin up multiple devs for multiple stories.

{"postId":"1kzgerr","subreddit":"ClaudeAI","title":"Claude Code vs Codex - TLDR Codex is Lazy, Claude is Great.","selftext":"<TLDR> Codex is lazy, ignores instructions, lacks attention to detalis, takes the road of least resistance, take shortcuts and hacks. Claude Code is on point, sometimes does too much but is great!</TLDR>  \n  \nJust because it's Friday and time for some fun.\n\nI've been an EXTENSIVE user of Claude Code ($200/month plan) and Open AI Plan, $200 as well. Thanks to u/ryoppippi's tool I know I spent the equivalent of $1400 if I would have paid... In 2 weeks with Claude Code. I've become an expert at it and prompting it right. \n\nI've been experimenting with OpenAI Codex but noticed it's been horrible at following instructions and is lazy. Anybody else noticing this as well?\n\nI've used Claude Code to generate Comprehensive stories to implement features ( I routinely use CC to write github issues, then work on them).\n\nUnfortunately Codex doesn't support Github integration so I copied my VERY DETAILED story and instructions.\n\nCodex did its (shitty) job, then I had Claude Code do a PR review. Asking to be a brutally honest commenter and harsh criticizer. Just for fun I am pasting partially what Claude Code wrote (not everything) with excellent feedback to fix the PR.\n\nThis is my the last summary from me asking Claude Code:  \n=====  \nWell, let's be fair here. PR #69 shows real improvement - it's the first one that actually compiles and runs. That's not nothing.\n\n**The developer:**\n\n* Fixed the build issues (finally)\n* Created a proper server-side client architecture\n* Added basic error handling and auth\n* Integrated with the monorepo correctly\n\n**But yes, there are still fundamental issues:**\n\n* Ignoring explicit instructions (Zod import after being told 3 times)\n* Taking shortcuts with any types everywhere\n* Missing the core requirement of semantic tool generation\n* Using hacky workarounds (shim files) instead of solving problems properly\n\n**The pattern suggests someone who can eventually get things working but:**\n\n1. Doesn't read requirements carefully\n2. Takes the path of least resistance\n3. Needs multiple iterations to get basics right\n\n**Results, PR #67 after 1 pass of Codex:**\n\n# ‚ùå Code Review: Critical Implementation Failures\n\nThis PR falls far short of the requirements and shows a concerning lack of attention to detail. Here's what's wrong:\n\n# üî¥ Build Failures & Basic Errors\n\n1. **Can't Even Build**¬†\\- The author admits in the PR description that¬†`tsc`¬†fails. Why submit a PR that doesn't compile when the instructions were clear that it must build?\n2. **Wrong Zod Import**¬†\\- Uses¬†`'zod'`¬†instead of¬†`'@hono/zod-openapi'`¬†\\- did you even read [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) as instructed?\n3. **Phantom Imports**¬†\\- Imports¬†`HttpServerTransport`¬†which doesn't exist in the MCP SDK. This suggests copy-paste without understanding.\n\n# üî¥ Completely Missed Core Requirements\n\n1. **No AxiosApiWithData**¬†\\- The ENTIRE POINT was to use the existing AxiosApiWithData implementation. Instead, you used plain axios. This breaks:\n   * Authentication consistency\n   * Error handling patterns\n   * Interceptor logic\n   * Everything we've already built\n2. **Terrible Tool Generation**¬†\\- The requirements explicitly state \"avoid 1:1 mapping\" yet you created exactly that:This creates garbage like¬†`api_get_users_id`¬†instead of semantic tools like¬†`manage_users`.\\`${name}\\_${method}\\_${path.replace(/\\[\\\\\\\\/{}\\]/g, '\\_')}\\`\n3. **Zero Parameter Handling**¬†\\- Just slapped¬†`additionalProperties: true`¬†on everything. No schema extraction, no validation, nothing.\n\n# üî¥ Incomplete Implementation\n\n* **No authentication**¬†\\- How do you expect this to work with protected endpoints?\n* **No error handling**¬†\\- Single try-catch? Really?\n* **No logging**¬†\\- How do we debug issues?\n* **No tests**¬†\\- Not even a single test file\n* **No semantic metadata**¬†\\- Where are the categories, capabilities, prerequisites?\n* **No OpenAPI validation**¬†\\- What if someone provides invalid specs?\n\n# üî¥ Poor Code Quality\n\netc...  \nüìä Score: 2/10\n\nThis looks like a rushed skeleton created in 30 minutes without reading the requirements. The only positive is that the folder structure somewhat matches the spec.\n\n# ‚úÖ What needs to happen:\n\n1. **Start over**¬†\\- This implementation is fundamentally flawed\n2. **Read the requirements**¬†\\- Actually understand what \"semantic tools\" means\n3. **Study the existing codebase**¬†\\- Learn how AxiosApiWithData works\n4. **Implement incrementally**¬†\\- Get it building first, then add features\n5. **Test as you go**¬†\\- Don't submit untested, non-building code\n\nThis PR should be closed and restarted with proper planning and implementation.\n\nThen PR #68's Review start with  \n‚ùå Code Review: Still Major Issues\n\nThis PR shows some improvements but still has critical failures and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the requirements and the existing codebase.\n\nüìä Score: 3/10","score":10,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1kzgerr/claude_code_vs_codex_tldr_codex_is_lazy_claude_is/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1kzgerr/claude_code_vs_codex_tldr_codex_is_lazy_claude_is/","author":"TrackOurHealth","created":1748641467,"numComments":51,"comments":[{"id":"mv578ll","parentId":null,"postId":"1kzgerr","depth":0,"text":"I‚Äôve been using CC for the last week and love it.

{"postId":"1nhvyu0","subreddit":"ClaudeAI","title":"OpenAI drops GPT-5 Codex CLI right after Anthropic's model degradation fiasco. Who's switching from Claude Code?","selftext":"Pretty wild timing for these two announcements, and I can't be the only one whose head has been turned.\n\nFor those who missed it, OpenAI just dropped a bombshell today (2025-09-15): a major upgrade to Codex with a new \"GPT-5-Codex\" model.\n\n[Link to OpenAI Announcement](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-upgrades-to-codex)\n\nThe highlights look seriously impressive:\n\n\\*   Truly Agentic: They're claiming it can work independently for hours, iterating on code, fixing tests, and seeing tasks through.\n\n\\*   Smarter Resource Use: It dynamically adapts its \"thinking\" time‚Äîsnappy for small requests, but digs in for complex refactors.\n\n\\*   Better Code Review: The announcement claims it finds more high-impact bugs and generates fewer incorrect/unimportant comments.\n\n\\*   Visual Capabilities: It can take screenshots, analyze images you provide (mockups/diagrams), and show you its progress visually.\n\n\\*   Deep IDE Integration: A proper VS Code extension that seems to bridge local and cloud work seamlessly.\n\nThis all sounds great, but what makes the timing so brutal is what's been happening over at Anthropic.\n\nLet's be real, has anyone else been fighting with Claude Code for the last month? The \"model degradation\" has been a real and frustrating issue. Their own status page confirmed that Sonnet 4 and even Opus were affected for weeks.\n\n[Link to Anthropic Status Page](https://status.anthropic.com)\n\nAnthropic say they've rolled out fixes as of Sep 12th, but the trust is definitely shaken for me. I spent way too much time getting weird, non-deterministic, or just plain 'bad' code suggestions.\n\nSo now we have a choice:\n\n\\*   Anthropic's Claude Code: A powerful tool with a ton of features, but it just spent a month being unreliable. We're promised it's fixed, but are we sure?\n\n\\*   OpenAI's Codex CLI: A brand new, powerful competitor powered by a new GPT-5-codex model, promising to solve the exact pain points of agentic coding, from a company that (at least right now) isn't having major quality control issues. Plus, it's bundled with existing ChatGPT plans.\n\nI was all-in on the Claude Code ecosystem, but this announcement, combined with the recent failures from Anthropic, has me seriously considering jumping ship. The promise of a more reliable agent that can handle complex tasks without degrading is exactly what I need.\n\nTL;DR: OpenAI launched a powerful new competitor to Claude Code right as Anthropic was recovering from major model quality issues. The new features of GPT-5-Codex seem to directly address the weaknesses we've been seeing in Claude.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is anyone else making the switch? Are the new Codex features compelling enough, or are you sticking with Anthropic and hoping for the best?","score":219,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nhvyu0/openai_drops_gpt5_codex_cli_right_after/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nhvyu0/openai_drops_gpt5_codex_cli_right_after/","author":"coygeek","created":1757965461,"numComments":252,"comments":[{"id":"nefahy2","parentId":null,"postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":0,"text":"It feels like people are treating ai like sports teams","score":188,"author":"Desalzes_","created":1757974583},{"id":"negg4b7","parentId":"nefahy2","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":1,"text":"I am rooting for the first one to respond to my support tickets.","score":64,"author":"matteiuspi","created":1757989214},{"id":"neh80ap","parentId":"negg4b7","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":2,"text":"im rooting for the first one to stop treating paying customers like beta testers","score":33,"author":"qodeninja","created":1758001402},{"id":"nenjgbr","parentId":"neh80ap","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":3,"text":"sdadada","score":1,"author":"Sufficient_Peak_2706","created":1758084780},{"id":"nelk0kn","parentId":"neh80ap","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":3,"text":"lmao lulz !\n\nwhats next, you are going to want them to have their own QA dept? \n\nmaybe a printed user manual?\n\nsoftware distributed on CDs?\n\na phone number with a human on the other end?\n\nwhere does this madness stop ! think of ceo‚Äôs children !","score":1,"author":"BigPlans2022","created":1758058382},{"id":"neh9k75","parentId":"negg4b7","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":2,"text":"ChatGPT support team got back to me within 15 minutes.","score":6,"author":"Waste-Head7963","created":1758002249},{"id":"nelk6hq","parentId":"neh9k75","postId":"1nhvyu0","depth":3,"text":"You are absolutely right!

{"postId":"1o174kr","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Codex CLI + GPT-5-codex still a more effective duo than Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5","selftext":"I have been using Codex for a while (since Sonnet 4 was nerfed), it has so far has been a great experience. And now that Sonnet 4.5 is here. I really wanted to test which model among Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-codex offers more value.\n\nSo, I built an e-com app (I named it vibeshop as it is vibe coded) using both the models using CC and Codex CLI with respective LLMs, also added MCP to the mix for a complete agent coding setup.\n\nI created a monorepo and used various packages to see how well the models could handle context. I built a clothing recommendation engine in TypeScript for a serverless environment to test performance under realistic constraints (I was really hoping that these models would make the architectural decisions on their own, and tell me that this can't be done in a serverless environment because of the computational load). The app takes user preferences, ranks outfits, and generates clean UI layouts for web and mobile.\n\nHere's what I found out.\n\n**Observations on Claude perf**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 started strong. It handled the design beautifully, with pixel-perfect layouts, proper hierarchy, and clear explanations of each step. I could never have done this lol. But as the project grew, it struggled with smaller details, like schema relations and handling HttpOnly tokens mapped to opaque IDs with TTL/cleanup to prevent spoofing or cross-user issues.\n\n**Observations on GPT-5-codex**\n\nGPT-5 Codex, on the other hand, had a better handling of the situation. It maintained context better, refactored safely, and produced working code almost immediately (though it still had some linter errors like unused variables). It understood file dependencies, handled cross-module logic cleanly, and seemed to ‚Äúget‚Äù the project structure better. The only downside was the developer experience of Codex, the docs are still unclear and there is limited control, but the output quality made up for it.\n\nBoth models still produced long-running queries that would be problematic in a serverless setup. It would‚Äôve been nice if they flagged that upfront, but you still see that architectural choices require a human designer to make final calls. By the end, Codex delivered the entire recommendation engine with fewer retries and far fewer context errors. Claude‚Äôs output looked cleaner on the surface, but Codex‚Äôs results actually held up in production.\n\nClaude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend.\n\n**Cost comparison:**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 + Claude Code: \\~18M input + 117k output tokens, cost around $10.26. Produced more lint errors but UI looked clean.  \nGPT-5 Codex + Codex Agent: \\~600k input + 103k output tokens, cost around $2.50. Fewer errors, clean UI, and better schema handling.\n\nI wrote a full breakdown¬†[Claude 4.5 Sonnet vs GPT-5 Codex](https://composio.dev/blog/claude-sonnet-4-5-vs-gpt-5-codex-best-model-for-agentic-coding),\n\nWould love to know what combination of coding agent and models you use and how you found Sonnet 4.5 in comparison to GPT-5.","score":127,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o174kr/codex_cli_gpt5codex_still_a_more_effective_duo/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o174kr/codex_cli_gpt5codex_still_a_more_effective_duo/","author":"Gullible-Time-8816","created":1759920602,"numComments":60,"comments":[{"id":"niei9wv","parentId":null,"postId":"1o174kr","depth":0,"text":"\"Claude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend.\"\n\nthis is the kind of reason I use multiple models, there is no current project I have that gpt or sonnet or any other current model would be universally better at every task. even sticking to just gpt and Claude is a bit limiting imo.\n\nQwen3-Coder-Plus for example I found better than Sonnet 4 on implementation on Unity code. not sure If 4.5 is better yet as I have not had enough time to test it\n\njust use all the tools, there is no universal best and this is seeming more and more apparent with every launch (for example Grok has no model that seems to have any idea about Unity code, likely no training at all, so it's likely moving away from JavaScript and python will see much more of a different LLM preference)\n\n  \nedit: I would be really interested in seeing some really multifaceted benchmarks such as task type, language etc","score":18,"author":"CC_NHS","created":1759921723},{"id":"niexl1f","parentId":"niei9wv","postId":"1o174kr","depth":1,"text":"100% multiple models.","score":3,"author":"RadSwag21","created":1759927949},{"id":"niexoku","parentId":"niexl1f","postId":"1o174kr","depth":2,"text":"Does Gemini fit in anyone's multiple stack here?","score":1,"author":"RadSwag21","created":1759927983},{"id":"nieyhh4","parentId":"niexoku","postId":"1o174kr","depth":3,"text":"not for coding, but for updating docs on architecture, folder layout etc I do, it's good the context, it's free and it's pretty good at documentation. if I wanted to go through a class and add comments for what each method does and such, I would use Gemini for that too, but I tend to try avoid much comments unless really needed","score":2,"author":"CC_NHS","created":1759928259},{"id":"niejwc1","parentId":"niei9wv","postId":"1o174kr","depth":1,"text":"Interesting, do you use IDE or any CLI and how do you manage with multiple models.

{"postId":"1ko86xz","subreddit":"LocalLLaMA","title":"Claude Code and Openai Codex Will Increase Demand for Software Engineers","selftext":"Recently, everyone who is selling API or selling interfaces, such as OpenAI, Google and Anthropic have been telling that the software engineering jobs will soon be extinct in a few years. I would say that this will not be the case and it might even have the opposite effect in that it will lead to increment and not only increment but even better paid.\n\nWe recently saw that Klarna CEO fired tons of people saying that AI will do everything and we are more efficient and so on, but now they are hiring again, and in great numbers. Google is saying that they will create agents that will \"vibe code\" apps, makes me feel weird to hear from Sir Demis Hassabis, a noble laureate who knows himself the flaws of these autoregressive models deeply. People are fearing, that software engineers and data scientists will lose jobs because the models will be so much better that everyone will code websites in a day.\n\nRecently an acquaintance  of mine created an app for his small startups for chefs, another one for a RAG like app but for crypto to help with some document filling stuff. They said that now they can become \"vibe coders\" and now do not need any technical people, both of these are business graduates and no technical background. After creating the app, I saw their frustration of not being able to change the borders of the boxes that Sonnet 3.7 made for them as they do not know what the border radius is. They subsequently hired people to help with this, and this not only led to weekly projects and high payments, for which they could have asked a well taught and well experienced front end person, they paid more than they should have starting from the beginning. I can imagine that the low hanging fruit is available to everyone now, no doubt, but vibe coding will \"hit a wall\" of experience and actual field knowledge.\n\nSelf driving will not mean that you do not need to drive anymore, but that you can drive better and can be more relaxed as there is another artificial intelligence to help you. In my humble opinion, a researcher working with LLMs, a lot of people will need to hire software engineers and will be willing to pay more than they originally had to as they do not know what they are doing. But in the short term there will definitely be job losses, but the creative and actual specialization knowledge people will not only be safe but thrive. With open source, we all can compliment our specializations.\n\nA few jobs that in my opinion will thrive: data scientists, researchers, optimizers, front end developers, backend developers, LLM developers and teachers of each of these fields. These models will be a blessing to learn easily, if people use them for learning and not just directly vibe coding, and will definitely be a positive sum for the scociety. But after seeing the people next to me, I think that high quality software engineers will not only be in demand, but actively sought after with high salaries and per hourly rates.\n\nI definitely maybe flawed in some senses in my thinking here, please point out so. I am more than happy to learn.","score":60,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ko86xz/claude_code_and_openai_codex_will_increase_demand/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ko86xz/claude_code_and_openai_codex_will_increase_demand/","author":"Desperate_Rub_1352","created":1747420251,"numComments":45,"comments":[{"id":"msouq7a","parentId":null,"postId":"1ko86xz","depth":0,"text":"\"vibe\" coding just makes dangerous trash code unless you audit it \n\nwhen will linux kernel devs \"vibe\" code some drivers?","score":42,"author":"TumbleweedDeep825","created":1747428554},{"id":"msp75b1","parentId":"msouq7a","postId":"1ko86xz","depth":1,"text":"Maybe nvidia has been vibe coding their drivers and that's why they suck so much lately.","score":21,"author":"NNN_Throwaway2","created":1747432521},{"id":"msqfrnj","parentId":"msouq7a","postId":"1ko86xz","depth":1,"text":"yes my point exactly. so many people accidentally release their api keys as they don‚Äôt know what they are doing which is unfortunate ofc. it‚Äôs like selling fsd to people who have never set foot in. the drivers seat before to drive on an autobahn","score":2,"author":"Desperate_Rub_1352","created":1747449823},{"id":"msqtqli","parentId":null,"postId":"1ko86xz","depth":0,"text":"I almost did not apply for a driving license, because of Elon saying ‚Äúfeature complete‚Äù about autopilot in 2016.\nFor over a year people have been yelling ‚Äúit‚Äôs over‚Äù with each new model update, and agents are still not very good and I still need to understand the code that I am writing.","score":14,"author":"magnus-m","created":1747456151},{"id":"msr1j3d","parentId":"msqtqli","postId":"1ko86xz","depth":1,"text":"yeah 100 percent.

A couple of data science specializations have already been wiped out by LLMs.\n\nIronically AI jobs such as mine are some of the first to fall. Software engineering doesn't have a long future ahead of it.\n\nPeople don't seem to understand just how quickly we're moving. Most AI labs are already tightening hiring because they expect most current roles to not be needed in a couple of years time. We're making rapid progress towards just closing the loop and having no humans in the loop at all for recursive self improvement of models.\n\nMost of the industry is converging to most knowledge work being done by AI by 2030, just 5 years from now. I won't expect physical jobs to be lagging behind by a lot, just that the physical machines would take a while to be build keeping humans employed in physical fields for longer.\n\nI think you're better off trying to spend your mental effort into planning how to live in a world without human knowledge workers. Don't try and keep married to your job mentally, it's not healthy and will make you less able to look at the broader picture rationally.\n\nMost leading AI researchers think their own jobs will only last 2-3 years, yet somehow regular software engineers which is just a small subset of our skills think they will last longer than that. Why do you think that is? Because software engineers have some magical third eye that sees the future? Or because they don't have a similar level of insight into the AI field?\n\nWe're *rapidly* closing the gap in making AI recursively self-improve towards superhuman levels of performance, especially in tasks that can be self-evaluated like *mathematics, coding, materials science, medicine* and *AI performance*.\n\nThose fields will be first hit and heaviest affected. I'm a computer scientist with almost a decade of ML experience with quite a couple of RL papers to my name and yet I don't expect to be employable in 5 years time with almost 100% certainty.

{"postId":"1k3uffy","subreddit":"cursor","title":"Agentic Showdown: Claude Code vs Codex vs Cursor","selftext":"Hey, everyone!\n\nSince OpenAI recently released Codex, I thought it‚Äôs a good idea to challenge the three top agentic coding tools against each other:\n\n- Claude Code with Sonnet 3.7\n- OpenAI Codex with o3\n- Cursor with Gemini 2.5 Pro Max\n\nAs a test, I used a video codec I‚Äôm currently implementing, ~2k lines of C++23 code.\nI gave all tools 3 tries to get it right.\n\n**First task: Implement an additional compression block**\n\nI marked the position in the code and pasted the specification.Difficulty: medium\n\nGemini: Was very fast, implementation looked good, but the video was distorted. I could upload a picture of the video to point out what‚Äôs wrong. Unfortunately, Gemini was unable to fix it.\n\nClaude: First try did complete nonsense. Second try, did something that looked alright, but the video again was distorted. Was also unable to fix it with the third try.Codex: Fascinating, it ran numerous weird commands (while true; do sleep 1; ls build/CMakeFiles/shared_lib.dir 2>/dev/null || true; done) but it did it first try. \n\n**Second task: Refactor two functions and merge them**\n\nDifficulty: simple\n\nGemini: First asked me to point to the file, then got stuck and refused to edit anything. Second try it did something, but forgot to update the tests and failed to do it after I asked. The refactor was also only half-done. Disappointing.\n\nClaude: Also did only half the job first try, but at least ran and fixed the tests. When I pointed out what was missing, it added a serious bug. When I pointed that out, it found a genius fix that not only fixed the bug but also improved the code a lot. Better than I could have done it. Chapeau!\n\nCodex: Likewise did only half a job first try. Finished the job second try. Code quality was worse than Claude, though.\n\n**Third task: Performance optimization**\n\nDifficulty: medium/hard\n\nGemini: Rewrote a lot of code, added a syntax error that it was able to fix second try. Generated video was corrupted and performance was not better. Bad.\n\nClaude: First try, sped up the code by 4x, but the video was unplayable. Second try 3x speed up, but video was only orange. Third try video again broken, 3x speed up.\n\nCodex: Finished surprisingly quickly, but the video was broken and it was actually SLOWER than before. Then it got funny, when I told it, it resolved the issues, but it also insisted that I was wrong and the code was indeed faster. I had to show it benchmark results to believe me. It then tried again but only got it down to the original timing.\n\n**General remarks**\n- Gemini is very fast compared to the others. Also, it‚Äôs not going in random circles grepping files. That makes it really nice to work with.\n- Claude has the best cost control ($8.67, running 29¬†mins total). I can‚Äôt tell what the others cost, I tried to find it in the backend but gave up.\n- All of them add tons of unnecessary comments, even if you tell them to stop (annoying).\n\n**Final Verdict**\n\nI can‚Äôt pick a clear winner. Cursor with Gemini seems a bit worse than the other two. But apart from that, all tools can deliver surprisingly good and surprisingly bad results.","score":47,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1k3uffy/agentic_showdown_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_cursor/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1k3uffy/agentic_showdown_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_cursor/","author":"floriandotorg","created":1745177247,"numComments":29,"comments":[{"id":"mo5d79h","parentId":null,"postId":"1k3uffy","depth":0,"text":"There is a proxy for Claude code that let's you use openai or Gemini API keys, could potentially be a fairer comparison, particularly for Gemini","score":10,"author":"jony7","created":1745181725},{"id":"mo8ffzp","parentId":"mo5d79h","postId":"1k3uffy","depth":1,"text":"Can you share?","score":1,"author":"emprezario","created":1745230773},{"id":"moamek5","parentId":"mo8ffzp","postId":"1k3uffy","depth":2,"text":"I think this one does a better job.

{"postId":"1mub9r5","subreddit":"ClaudeAI","title":"Experiences with CC, Codex CLI, Qwen Coder (Gemini CLI)?","selftext":"Hey there,\n\nas slowly more and more CLI Agents are appearing and there is potentially more to select and keep an eye out for, I was wanting to hear how others have experienced other tools & the respective subscriptions?\n\n**Claude Code:**  \nI've been using CC now for a while on the 5x Plan, it does work great, mostly, sometimes there is a bit of hiccup or it just does some bullshitery but as long as the task is in a given \"context size\" it does perform well. I recently had to use it to debug an issue/bug, unfortunately not super aware where and how it occurs, that was the first time that CC was unable to really perform anything relevant, as by simply trying to grep/search files and do a few web clicks it would fill up the context window and after that it was pretty much caught on a loop. But that aside, one big issue I have, the second it gets close to the context window limit or that my \"limit\" will reach, it will basically lie and say he has tested and everything is fine and apparently I build a production application. What works really well though is the Integration with various MCP's and tool calling.\n\n**Qwen Coder:**  \nThis recently came out, and one can use it for free by just signing in with your account, I have yet to hit the limits for this, it offers a similar performance to Sonnet 4.0, and features a 1m context window. I have to say Qwen Coder has been far superior in my case when it came to pure coding tasks, it seems to do proper research in the codebase before starting to edit random files in order to not break existing functionality (usually it spends a good 150-200k on researching). It is a tad on the slower side in terms of responses, but that may be because I am not using the API. That being said, the issue I encountered is, it doesn't do very well with certain MCP's, it gets occasionally confused with Playwright and how to use it, but if it doesn't it somehow clicks so fast that one can barely read/react what it does, whereas Claude takes his time here. Given the Qwen Coder is a fork from Gemini CLI and that it just came out, this looks extremely promising and i would get a subscription if it was offered as the pure code performance seems to be superior to CC in my few use-cases (php, js, and some svelte)\n\n**Codex CLI:**  \nI have to admit I was not aware until very recently that one can use the ChatGPT subscription (plus,team,pro) to use the Codex CLI. I just tested it for roughly two nights, but I am extremely pleased on how ChatGPT 5 performs for certain debugging / coding tasks. It also seems to \"watch\" out for other bugs/potential improvements even if it is not part of the main task.

{"postId":"1nf5oic","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Experience Report (Sep 2025): Claude Code vs Codex","selftext":"My experience: Claude Code CLI vs Codex\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my recent experience with Claude Code and Codex, in case it helps anyone.\n\nI started a few months ago with Claude Code after using RooCode (too pricey for me). At first, Claude Code was great: I‚Äôd give it a prompt, it would search the files, understand the context, and generate solid code. Honestly, I barely needed to double-check.\n\nOver time, though, things went downhill. It got increasingly ‚Äúdumb,‚Äù to the point where using it felt like fighting it just to get something close to what I asked.\n\nI had a pretty disciplined setup:\n\t‚Ä¢\tA clean cloud.md (project context),\n\t‚Ä¢\tA backend.md describing the layers (routes, services, repository, hooks, etc.), dev patterns, and hard rules‚Äîe.g., never use SQLAlchemy directly; always go through the repository‚Äîrepeated multiple times,\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd slash commands to keep things methodical:\n\t‚Ä¢\t/plan ‚Üí generate a full action plan from our discussion,\n\t‚Ä¢\t/split ‚Üí break that plan into atomic tasks,\n\t‚Ä¢\t/exec ‚Üí execute a single atomic task, with references to backend.md and the per-task summary (objective, watch-outs, files to change, etc.).\n\nOn paper, it should‚Äôve worked. In practice:\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe plans were consistently wrong (non-existent methods, unsolicited refactors).\n\t‚Ä¢\tEven after splitting into atomic tasks, I had to proofread everything.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd despite the repeated constraints in the context files, Claude Code did its own thing.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI kept asking, ‚ÄúWhy did you change this when it wasn‚Äôt in the plan?‚Äù\n\nIt became a mess.\n\nBased on feedback I saw here on Reddit, I switched to Codex. Big surprise: it feels like the early Claude again.\n\nWith Codex:\n\t‚Ä¢\tI no longer need the complicated command workflow. I just discuss what I want; it actually analyzes the context.\n\t‚Ä¢\tYes, it‚Äôs a bit slower‚Äîbut when I say ‚Äúimplement,‚Äù it implements correctly.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe biggest change: with Claude Code, every modified file had errors (missing imports/methods, broken data access, etc.).\nWith Codex, after a full day of dev, not a single red squiggle in my IDE. Everything works, and I can move forward.\n\nTL;DR\n\t‚Ä¢\tClaude Code helped at first but quickly regressed to the point of being unusable for me.\n\t‚Ä¢\tCodex currently feels reliable and smooth‚ÄîI can just build.\n\nCurious if others had the same arc with Claude Code, or if it was just me.","score":8,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nf5oic/experience_report_sep_2025_claude_code_vs_codex/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nf5oic/experience_report_sep_2025_claude_code_vs_codex/","author":"OrganicClub6474","created":1757689540,"numComments":6,"comments":[{"id":"ndtvhd9","parentId":null,"postId":"1nf5oic","depth":0,"text":"I've been using Codex more lately...the terminal interface is worse and it doesn't explain it's changes as well as Claude and sometimes has complete misses but it's a good tool to have in the arsenal.","score":2,"author":"TheInnerWebs","created":1757689831},{"id":"ndtypjb","parentId":"ndtvhd9","postId":"1nf5oic","depth":1,"text":"Yeah, totally agree ‚Äî CC has the smoother UX.¬†\n\nCodex is not flawless, but honestly, compared to my last run with CC yesterday, Codex just gets stuff done way better overall.","score":1,"author":"OrganicClub6474","created":1757690743},{"id":"ndvfq10","parentId":null,"postId":"1nf5oic","depth":0,"text":"Ive found claude.md is more of a reference than a ruleset enforcement doc nowadays.

Ive found if you low level program with claude, do this then this. If this do this. And take all the \"thinking\" out until it needs to, it works a lot better. Claude needs very strict structure and a long narrow hallway to function, otherwise you get chaos.\n\n\nAt this point im just building guard rails against its bad training example data like type any with pre hooks and it works pretty well.\n\n\nI think what happened was there used to be more emphasis on claude.md as a rule doc, but through balancing (which maybe that was the original intention anyway) we now have other tools to enforce.\n\n\nAs they say, you can use a tool, but it takes a while to master it. Specific LLMs have their idiosyncrasies that you have to get around like any other tooling and they evolve so you have to pivot with it. Hopscotching between tooling when one isnt doing great means youre never gonna really master one.\n\n\nBut thats just my opinion. Once something works good enough for me, id rather just be flexible than have to relearn and resetup stuff for a completely diff ecosystem.

One example I caught: it literally told me *‚Äúyou have 1000 but you need 100 so it won‚Äôt work‚Äù* basically doing the math wrong and then blaming my code for it.\n\nThat‚Äôs just one example. It‚Äôll add hardcoded logs even though I use dynamic ones, then keep using its own mistake like it never even read the existing code. Instead of fixing the actual bug, it derails into fake logic checks or wrong assumptions.\n\nI‚Äôve been coding for 18 years, I‚Äôm not new to this, and I‚Äôve used Claude Code for about 6 months (really heavy the past 3). In the beginning it was solid, but in the last 1‚Äì2 months the quality has noticeably dropped. These past 3 days were the breaking point. And there‚Äôs zero transparency about limits or why the quality swings. Today I even hit the 5-hour cap on the max plan for the first time, even though I coded less than usual.\n\nI‚Äôd been avoiding Codex because I had some ChatGPT trauma, but my friend kept telling me it‚Äôs way better. So I finally tried it today. Three prompts in, it fixed the exact same logic/math problem Claude had been fumbling for days. Clean, correct, done. Minutes instead of days. It even cleaned up the garbage Claude had left behind. Honestly it felt like using Claude back when it was still good.\n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm done babysitting Claude Code. I‚Äôm asking for a refund and moving to Codex. After testing it today, the difference is insane. My advice to other devs: just try it yourself. I can‚Äôt speak for frontend/design, but if you‚Äôre working on backend or heavy transformer logic, don‚Äôt even bother with Claude it misses so many details it‚Äôs honestly scary. It‚Äôs reset my git, messed with my env, and when you run searches it still uses 2024 data. It used to reach into 2025, so clearly they‚Äôve dialed something back to save compute or whatever. And please, spare me the whole ‚Äòcontext engineering‚Äô garbage, that‚Äôs just fanboy cope. When CC get their s\\*\\* together i will give it another try later as i still like their framework.  /// **UPDATE:** Been using Codex since the switch and so far it‚Äôs been solid  no complaints at all.

I'm still working out the details of exactly how the Claude side of the workflow should function - like how I should use subagents and slash commands. But the overall idea is that you have a conversation with Claude to identify any unspoken assumptions or unclear requirements, then Claude generates prompts. I literally don't talk to Codex at all, I just copy the prompts over and leave it to work on its own. \n\nI think using Codex Cloud rather than the CLI or IDE extension is essential for the way I use it because cloud tasks are built to run without any human intervention, where CLI agent tools are generally built to keep the human in the loop. I've had it literally run a task for 15+ minutes on it's own and when I check the logs it ran into some big problem I would have hated dealing with and Codex just solved the problem itself. And cloud tasks manage their own separate environments so you can run like 2-4+ tasks at the same time if you make sure to ask Claude to specify which tasks are dependent on previous tasks. And when it's done you have it submit a pull request to add the code which helps with observability.\n\nI can't wait for them to add cloud task delegation to the Codex CLI. You can delegate with the IDE extension and the docs say they're adding it to the CLI soon. But right now it's very manual and I have to copy-paste every step. I tried writing a tool to automate pasting the prompt but I got flagged as a bot pretty much instantly. I think it might be possible to delegate with github actions though which could be a good way to automate the workflow. \n\nRight now this is very unexplored territory, at least for me. I've had a project where it pretty much nailed an entire refactor in one go without any help, but in a different project it failed completely to the point that I had to just delete everything. I've tried exploring how things work when I go back-and-forth more, like debugging when the output from Codex doesn't work.

Also using codex reply to try to sync context between both conversations sounds fantastic. I‚Äôve also run into some issues with how the codex MCP is set up though. \n\nRight now I really don‚Äôt do much myself to engineer my prompts for Codex. I‚Äôm a total Codex noob and I specifically subscribed so that I could test out how I could use it as a worker agent under Claude‚Äôs instructions. I haven‚Äôt set a system prompt or written an AGENTS.md or really customized it in any way yet, it‚Äôs basically just how it is out of the box. I‚Äôve put too much effort into the Claude side so it‚Äôs time to learn more about how to get the most out of Codex. \n\nI basically spend like up to 2-3+ hours just brainstorming and writing requirements with Claude. I treat that as if I were actually coding, with the goal of writing out requirements so detailed that any implementation of a listed feature could not possibly be any different than what I‚Äôd code myself without breaking the requirements. As we go I‚Äôll have it generate a bunch of different context files like ideas.md and PRD.md. \n\nOnce I‚Äôm ready to spin up Codex I‚Äôll have Claude give me a file with prompts for all the tasks we need to delegate - with metadata telling me which tasks can be run in parallel.

{"postId":"1n2h4sb","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"CC to Codex - 1 Week Later","selftext":"**TLDR:** Claude Code is slow, bloated, and absurdly expensive if you actually go via API. GPT-5 with Codex CLI/IDE is barebones, missing all the Claude ‚Äúextras,‚Äù but it just gets the job done. Faster, cheaper, less theatrical than Claude. Not perfect, but actually usable.\n\n**Here‚Äôs what my old CC setup looked like:**\n\n* Several [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) files\n* MCPs\n* .Agents\n* .Hooks\n* Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution, except for the occasional model specific run based on agent's setup\n* Every agent forced to spit out a spec (requirements, design, tasks) before handing things off to the next etc\n\n**GPT-5 enters the picture.**  \nI tested it in Cursor after watching a few (**way too positive**) YouTube reviews. Honestly? It was 'fine'. Maybe slightly more coherent than Claude in its reasoning, but the outputs felt broadly the same. Since I already had the Claude Max 20√ó subscription, I didn‚Äôt bother switching.\n\nTime goes by. Claude‚Äôs results weren‚Äôt bad, but the speed was intolerable. Five minutes for edits. Token usage through the roof. By back-of-the-napkin math, my ‚Äúcasual‚Äù use was costing Anthropic $3‚Äì4k/month in API terms. Only thing making it viable was their flat subscription.\n\n**Codex CLI shook things up.**  \nAs soon as it supported ChatGPT subscriptions, I tried it - here is my initial [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1mw9cdf/claude_code_vs_codex_w_gpt5/). Ended up upgrading to the $200 Pro plan after a few days.\n\nCodex is basically Claude Code stripped of its frills:\n\n* No (intuitive way) to setup MCPs\n* No .Agents or .Hooks\n* Some config fiddling if you want to setup [Agents.md](http://Agents.md) (Claude.md equivalent - not an actual .Agents equivalent)\n\nYou lose the shiny extras, but what you gain is blunt efficiency. Tell it to do something, and it actually does it. No drama, no ‚Äúlet me draft a strategy memo first.‚Äù\n\n**The unexpected win:** the Pro plan gives you also 250 GPT-5 Pro calls via ChatGPT. Initially, I didnt even know about it nor when to use it. Then, this saved me when I was knee-deep in a nightmare involving Convex schema, LLM behavior, and auth weirdness. Six hours of going in circles, even GPT-5 'High' couldn‚Äôt untangle it. Out of frustration, I asked Codex to generate a markdown prompt laying out every detail for Pro (ca. 550 lines).\n\nFed that to GPT-5 Pro. **Ten minutes later**, it produced a solution that worked perfectly on the first attempt. Six hours wasted when the answer was sitting there the whole time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygnl3jn39slf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e1d56b654d46312b20b02c2455750bc5cb281f\n\n**Final thoughts.**  \nAnthropic had a good run. Opus 4 felt exciting at launch, and the Opus Plan + 1m Sonnet context + Opus 4.1 release felt like nice \"cherries on top of the cake\". But the pricing is absurd, and waiting forever for an execution cycle kills momentum.\n\n**GPT-5 via Codex is not flawless**. It is barebones compared to Claude Code, but also MUCH cheaper, faster, and better at just doing the damn thing you ask it to do. If you can stomach the missing niceties, it is worth a try.. \n\n**Anthropic team** ‚Äì doubt you‚Äôre reading this, but you really need to drop a new model or a meaningful release soon. You‚Äôve staked your reputation on being the ‚Äú**coding LLM**‚Äù, and now a 'generalist shop' is going toe to toe with you for a fraction of the price. You can only justify a premium, if your product is worth it to the eyes of the consumer. \n\nClaude Chrome is cute and I am excited to give it a go once its released, but nobody was asking for a browser gimmick. \n\nWe want Opus 5, not a Chrome extension. \n\nLeave the toys to Perplexity.","score":220,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1n2h4sb/cc_to_codex_1_week_later/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1n2h4sb/cc_to_codex_1_week_later/","author":"TimeKillsThem","created":1756398850,"numComments":143,"comments":[{"id":"nb5xze7","parentId":null,"postId":"1n2h4sb","depth":0,"text":"If you‚Äôre still paying $200/mo is it cheaper?

I start off with a rough system design in claude desktop, feed the same design parameters into gpt5, both output a result. But claude has the advantage. I put together an MCP server for use with unreal engines source code repo (using Zoekt text search in source code - super fast) - and a file system extension to actually access and view my project (primarily for namespace consistency, etc).\n\ni ask them both to critique one anothers design by searching for critical gaps and opportunities for optimisation. I go back and forth until we reach a threshold that satisfies a basic design. I feed the specs into claude code. In claude code (per system/subsystem design) i update the .md doc to specifically outline this sessions objectives, including an overview of my policies (coding standards, etc) and include my agents. I'm aware of context overload so my [claude.md](http://claude.md) never exceeds 200 - 300 lines. My agents are also about 80 lines max with very specific instructions - no ambiguities. I also have a documentation agent to track previous implementations/changes so there's clear record of what we've done since the projects conception (not to mention access to git mcp).\n\nWithstanding the contextual advantages that claude code has over chatgpt - claude code has recently been consistent in providing sub-standard implementations and ignoring explicit instructions, lying about using tools and makes excuses about over-engineering. To the point where i almost cant trust claude code to implement code for me with specific instructions to follow the designs exactly as they are shown. One thing that never misses a beat though are my hooks. which is nice.\n\ngpt5 rarely fails in this regard. When i ask it to critique claudes implementation, it comes back with a comprehensive list of gaps. Claude on the other hand, often starts by saying gpt5 design is superior and has told me in previous sessions to favour gpt5 design over its own. Claudes critique of gpt5 design tends to also be shallow and doesnt challenge gpt5 assumptions, but gpt5 critique challenges all of claudes assumptions consistently.\n\nCan confirm my claude environment isn't overloaded in context, the language and instructions i use are very specific, there is NO ambiguity, and my instructions are typically prefixed with a 'keep this as simple as possible, do not over-engineer, avoid scope drifting and ask 2 levels of 5 probing questions as a minimum'.\n\nPlain and simple, my experience is that gpt5 performs better lately than claude in the unreal engine coding domain for me as of typing this.

We also know that enterprise clients are a huge area of importance for Anthropic\n* Claude Code basically invented this space. It was the only serious coding CLI tool for a long time.

This caused a decline in response quality, including inaccurate answers and formatting errors. However, Anthropic quickly rolled back the changes to restore original performance and fixed related issues in earlier model versions. Officially, this dumbing down was unintended and promptly addressed by the company to maintain user experience and model quality.\n\nAdditionally, some users have reported perceivable declines in Opus performance over time, especially with document processing changes related to retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which changed how many documents the model reviews for context. This has led to some frustrations but is linked to system design updates rather than deliberate dumbing down.\n\nAnthropic officially states they have not deliberately reduced model capabilities but focus on balancing safety, efficiency, and reliability. Their more recent models like Claude Opus 4.1 have introduced stricter safety protocols while improving real-world usability and coding tasks.

My impression is that Claude Code has much nicer UI, but Codex is by far the stronger AI -- better at code-research, planning, bug-finding, fixing. This comes at the cost of taking 2-3x as long: it does deeper and better work, which takes more time.\n\nHere's one side-by-side experiment [https://github.com/ljw1004/codex-trace/blob/main/claude-codex-comparison/comparison.md](https://github.com/ljw1004/codex-trace/blob/main/claude-codex-comparison/comparison.md) where I gave the two systems the exact same prompt and compared their outputs.\n\nIn general, I've been asking Claude+Codex to each do some work, e.g. doing some code, or research, and then (anonymizing it) I've asked both Claude+Codex to compare+contrast the two works produced. About 2/3 of the time both of them agree that Codex did the better job; about 1/3 of the time they each think their own work is superior. I have not yet found a case where they both agreed that Claude did a better job.\n\nThat's unimportant though. There's no reason to think that Claude or Codex are any good at evaluating the outputs. I've been primarily relying on my own human evaluation of their outputs.\n\nThe only area where I preferred Claude's work is in HTML+CSS. It's often been finding simpler approaches there.\n\nClaude Code's architecture is superior, e.g. sub-agents and hooks. Claude feels more open, e.g. OpenAI has server-side mechanisms to disallow me from replacing the system prompt. Apparently I can do that with an API key but I haven't yet had time. I just like the feel of Anthropic as a company built by software engineers for software engineers.\n\n(Why am I spending so much time and money on comparing them? I'm paid enough as a senior software engineer, and my team is building its own software agents for internal use within the company, so I need to be 100% on top of what direction the industry is moving in. I therefore spend a lot of time doing my own hobby projects and investigations. I wrote [https://github.com/ljw1004/claude-log](https://github.com/ljw1004/claude-log) and [https://github.com/ljw1004/codex-trace](https://github.com/ljw1004/codex-trace) as part of digging into what they're doing. And I love hobby coding! these products are an excuse for me to bunk off work and do my own personal hobby projects like [https://github.com/ljw1004/geopic](https://github.com/ljw1004/geopic) and my management nevertheless sees this as useful research :) )","score":22,"author":"lucianw","created":1759871321},{"id":"nici76j","parentId":"nibc4ct","postId":"1o0olc1","depth":1,"text":"I‚Äôve found the same.

For example, I‚Äôve been doing a bunch of circuit modeling of analog hardware by spending a few hours gathering hardware data, algorithms, etc.\n\nThen I feed all of that into a coding agent and have it build it out.\n\nI‚Äôve also been working on really specialized thing for a game I‚Äôm working on.

Claude cannot do it at all. Claude Code is great, and very intuitive, and I strongly prefer it in almost every way. But the models just can‚Äôt handle this kind of work.\n\nCodex CLI is primitive and often frustrating, but if you give it a mountain of research, it can often get through the work with enough trial and error. Don‚Äôt expect it to be fast. But I‚Äôve currently got a state of the art Gaussian splat renderer for my game that integrates multiple cutting edge research papers, and I think what I have may actually be unique. Though even then, there are still times where knowing software development is useful. Codex got completely stuck trying to figure out how to calculate collisions with Gaussian splats where the geometry only exists in a shader, meaning it can‚Äôt be inspected by the CPU.

{"postId":"1mw9cdf","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Claude Code VS Codex w/ GPT5","selftext":"**TLDR: If you are on a budget, the $20/month ChatGPT Plus plan is PERFECT for you.**\n\nSo, Ive been running some experiments using both my Claude Code setup (Hooks + Agents + MCPs | mix of Sonnet and Opus based on the agent, with Opus planning on) and Codex (GPT5 High only, no MCPs etc).\n\nHere are my 2 cents:\n\n1. **Collaborator:** GPT5 is much better at sharing its thoughts and logic compared to Claude Code. For context, it feels more like a \"Cursor\" of sorts, sharing reasoning and next steps in the chat, making it much easier to follow along and understand exactly when it did what and why. It doesnt just show Diffs, its almost like you are \"reading it's mind\" as it doesnt just contain the steps/thinking logic, but also it's \"personality\" - extract below for you to better understand what I mean (yes - those count as tokens used). Here some of my favourites:\n   1. \"I need to focus on the relevant sections to ensure an accurate patch. My first step is to search for \"actions.ts\" to identify any gating and content elements that might need adjustments. This sounds like a straightforward task, but I want to ensure I don't miss any critical parts while I'm digging through the code! I'm curious about what specific changes I might need to implement. Let's get to work on this!\"\n   2. \"I'm noticing that the type-check failed earlier, and I think it was probably TypeScript raising a fuss about it. I guess I need to run tsc again to check for any specific errors. It's a bit frustrating, but it makes sense to get to the bottom of it and see what's going wrong. Let's see what the output reveals so I can address any issues correctly!\"\n2. **Speed**: Its FAST - coming from my CC setup above, despite running agents in parallel etc, GPT5 is blazing fast at reading/editing/browsing/writing etc compared to CC. **I can't stress this enough** \\- GPT5 via Codex is so much faster than CC (despite the setup and all the optimizations) that its insane. Even if GPT5 takes 3 tries to get the same output as CC (almost never the case), for me right now its better to fail fast and patch, than to one shot but take several minutes doing it with little knowledge of how it did what and why.\n3. **Plan Mode:** well... it doesnt have one. Mitigate via the typical \"dont code yet\" but it doesnt give me (as the user) the same level of perceived confidence CC gives me. Having said that, when you manually add \"dont code yet - draft a plan for x, y, z etc\", the output of the plan is stellar and usually automatically structured into:\n   1. Macro goal/Objective\n   2. High-level approach\n   3. Planned changes (by area)\n   4. Execution Steps (listed in order)\n   5. Acceptance Criteria (for review)\n   6. Notes on Docs Compliance (AKA Sources - usually official docs for the relevant stack)\n4. **Task Adherence:** It is genuinely impressive how well it sticks with the task provided in the prompt. Dont underestimate this... as, at times, it felt like it could become a double-edged sword! You ask for \"X\", it will deliver \"X\". You are unclear on what \"X\" is, you will be struggling.\n5. **Context window:** Both input as well as output being bigger than CC is a very nice to have. This is great especially if you are a big Opus user as Sonnet now has a mastodontic 1m context window, but opus is still not there. Despite not having agents to offload context to, and literally using GPT5 as a straight-up-chatbot of sorts, I still find myself not fearing the \"context window limit reached\" as i was with Opus before setting up agents and hooks.\n6. **Rate Limits:** Im on the Plus plan (the 20$ p/month plan I bought a while ago for normal chatgpt), have been on GPT5 high for the last 6 hours, havent hit limits once. As per CC, when you launch Codex, it will ask you to login either via ChatGPT or provide an API key.\n7. **Format Support:** right now, Codex ONLY supports text + links + copy/paste. No image support which makes debugging frontend a bit of a pain having to describe something instead of just sharing a screenshot.\n\n**IF** GPT5 had MCP/Agents/Hooks/alltheothercooltinyadditions that CC has, I would probably look into switching.\n\nWhat really blew my mind is that (likely due to ignorance) I never thought of an OpenAi model as a valid partner for coding. Yes o3 and a few other models can be good, but since they didn't have a CLI and their IDE integration was always quite poor (I remember when 4.o was the only model on Cursor that could not write code directly) or the model itself was never available via subscription, I never really considered them as a potential partner.\n\nIn my eyes, Anthropic always had \"the crown\", with Gemini models following soon along with the occasional open source player. Now, im not so sure it is still the case....\n\nIll update this post in the coming days with what I figure out hoping it can be of help to someone out there.\n\n**Update 1: Does it make sense to bet on OpenAi?**\n\nWhat worries me is that OpenAI is a run of the mill LLM house. They want to win in mass adoption, not niche specialty. While GPT5 can be useful for coding tasks, is it really smart to bet on a LLM house that has shown as much interest in coding as in voice processing, image generation, general use, math olympics etc? AKA longterm the bet is always with the specialist (Anthropic in this case) and not with the other LLM Houses (at least thats how I see it)\n\n**Update 2: Finally hit rate limits.**\n\nThe token counter on the bottom claims 188k tokens but I have serious doubts it actually reflects the tokens used in the session, and instead looks at the tokens used before using /compact.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3qblg5r2ekf1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba2629f0e36ec53e32f94c0ba06f17242861107c\n\nUsing a token counter (take it with a pinch of salt), it looks like the chat alone was ca 100k tokens (doesn't include all the reads/writes etc not present in the chat itself)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvmi7hbc3ekf1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed528828d63831b871c3bd693f77e2a31a33bb7\n\n**Update 3:** [**Agents.md**](http://Agents.md) **& MCP setup.**\n\nThe cons, its definitely way more finnicky than Claude Code / Cursor etc. You have to find the .codex folder which is installed at global level, then either use nano to modify the [agents.md](http://agents.md) and config.toml files or open the folder in an IDE and just freetype it there.\n\nOn the plus side, you can have A LOT of [agents.md](http://agents.md) files and, the closer to your project they are, the more they will be given precedence/priority. For example, you can have a global [agents.md](http://agents.md) file that lists MCPs and common guidelines. Then have another [agents.md](http://agents.md) file in your project root that specifically instructs the GPT on how to interact with it (specific commands to run etc) - really interesting approach and it works flawlessly.\n\nAgain, GPT5's ability to adhere to tasks and instructions is what makes this incredibly effective as, GPT5 actually does what's written on the [agents.md](http://agents.md) file (its not a gamble like the [claude.md](http://claude.md) situation).\n\nNow, having said that, automatic use of MCPs is either unclear or not shown in the chat. By this I mean I have it setup in my [agents.md](http://agents.md) file for GPT5 automatically detect when to use which MCP based on the nature of the request. Either this part is not working as it should (maybe gpt 5 is using them but not reporting it in the chat?), or my instructions in the [agents.md](http://agents.md) file are not good enough. Will update on this, In the meantime, below my [agents.md](http://agents.md) file if you have any tips.\n\n**Update 4: MCPs.**\n\nHave been playing around with MCPs and noticed they only get properly called when you give GPT5 the highest permissions in the CLI.\n\n***CONS:*** This CAN be dangerous (think of it as running Claude in dangerous mode). Now, given how well GPT5 adheres to tasks and [agents.md](http://agents.md) file, Im less worried. But still something to mindful of.\n\n***PROS:*** From the limited experience so far, MCPs work even better on GPT5 than they do in Claude. Specifically, Playwright is flawless on GPT5.\n\n**Update 5:** **The CLI crashes during big tasks..** Didnt happen yesterday (was running only semi-small commands) but it looks like (at least in Ghostty on Mac) it gets to a point of having so many lines in the terminal that the CLI just crashes and text input is not enabled/suffers SEVERE lag. The solution I found was to just close and open a new one (In my [agents.md](http://agents.md) file I had it structured so that for each task it creates an md file detailing it and steps taken etc so I can just reference that document). I assume its a bug but given this is meant to be running on large tasks, it is definitely something to keep in mind.\n\n**Update 6: GPT5 is either lazy or smart - still unclear.** Im having it run some pretty heavy refactoring on a project. Some of the files in the project can have quite a few lines of code... this is what GPT5 shared in the chat:\n\n* \"I think it makes sense to move the XXXX functions to a new file and simplify YYYY.ts to keep only the existing function. **Recreating the entire original heavy content seems like too much work**. Since I can‚Äôt retrieve the exact pre-edit file, I have a new plan.\"\n\nIm letting it proceed to see what it will do and then will come back with the confirmation on whether it is being lazy, or it found a more efficient way to structure the file/call the function etc.\n\n**Update 7: GPT5 is a lot more cautious than Claude.** I am not sure if this is due to my [agents.md](http://agents.md) instructions, or if it is hardcoded into the \"development best practices\" of the model but, GPT5 is a lot more cautious about new functionality implementation, pushing the user almost always to implement the functionality but gatekeep it behind a feature flag that can be toggled on/off. See reponse below:\n\n* \"If you want, I can implement the FSM + pre-seeded turns behind a feature flag (PRESEEDED\\_ONBOARDING) so we can test safely and roll back easily.\"\n\nI have not prompted GPT5 to do this. I am pleasantly surprised it offers me this. Now, this will likely cause code bloat in the longrun, but so far I am happy with this approach.\n\nBTW - shameless plug, posting updates and other GPT5/Codex related stuff I find out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAi\\_Coding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAi_Coding/)\n\nOld [agents.md](http://agents.md) file content:\n\n    # AGENTS.md ‚Äî Global House Rules for Coding Agents\n    \n    ## Purpose\n    Standardize agent behavior across all projects. Default to \n    *plan-first*\n    , minimize surprises, and justify changes with **official documentation**.\n    \n    ## Scope & Precedence\n    - Applies to this directory and all subfolders.\n    - If multiple `AGENTS.md` exist, **the deepest file wins** for conflicting rules.\n    - **Direct user/system instructions override** these defaults.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 0) Atomic Code Principle (Do Not Break the Castle)\n    - **Isolation:** Each change must be \n    *atomic*\n     and local to a well-defined module/component. No hidden cross-module side effects.\n    - **Low coupling / high cohesion:** Communicate via explicit, typed (or well-documented) interfaces. No global singletons for business state.\n    - **Stable boundaries:** Respect architectural layers (UI ‚Üî services ‚Üî data). If a boundary change is required, document it and guard it with tests.\n    - **Reversibility:** A single revert should remove the change without collateral damage.\n    - **Proof:** Provide boundary tests (or update existing) demonstrating unchanged behavior outside the edited module.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 1) Operating Mode (Plan-First)\n    - **Default deliverable = Plan/Diagnosis Only.** Do not modify files or run destructive commands unless the user explicitly asks to implement.\n    - **Exception: AI change journal (¬ß17) is ALWAYS created** (non-destructive metadata) at task start; see ¬ß17 for path/template.\n    - When asked to implement, **confirm a minimal plan** first, then execute.\n    - Treat models as **stateless**. Summarize the context you rely on in each plan.\n    \n    ### Plan Template (use verbatim)\n    - **Verdict:** one-liner.\n    - **Why this approach:** 2‚Äì4 bullets, each with an **official doc link**.\n    - **Risks/assumptions:** bullets.\n    - **Steps:** numbered, minimal.\n    - **What to verify:** checklist tied to acceptance criteria.\n    - **Deliverables:** files/paths to be touched.\n    - **Acceptance criteria:** objective tests.\n    - **Doc links:** official sources only.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 2) Source-of-Truth Policy\n    - **Use official documentation only** (e.g., MDN, react.dev, nextjs.org, cloud.google.com, go.dev, docs.python.org, pkg.go.dev, docs.rs, doc.rust-lang.org, nodejs.org).\n    - If no official source exists, say **‚Äúnot sure‚Äù** and propose a verification plan.\n    - For each technical claim or API choice, **link the exact doc page/section** used.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 3) Change Management\n    - **Never** perform sweeping refactors without an explicit user request.\n    - Prefer **small, reversible changes** behind flags or branches.\n    - Always create or propose a **feature branch** (`feat/<area>-<desc>` or `fix/<area>-<desc>`).\n    - **Commit messages**: Title ‚â§72 chars (imperative). Body explains \n    *Why*\n    , \n    *What changed*\n    , and \n    *Links*\n     (official docs/issues).\n    - **PR template**: Context ‚Üí Proposed change ‚Üí Alternatives ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Test plan ‚Üí Acceptance criteria ‚Üí Doc links.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 4) Coding Standards (Language-Agnostic)\n    - **Determinism:** avoid time/locale randomness in core logic; inject clocks/RNGs.\n    - **Observability:** minimal boundary logs (inputs, decisions, external calls). No secrets in logs.\n    - **Error handling:** fail fast on invariants; return structured errors; include remediation hints.\n    - **I/O boundaries:** isolate network/file/DB code; keep pure logic testable.\n    - **Dependencies:** prefer stdlib; add deps only with justification + official docs link.\n    - **Security:** no plaintext secrets; use env/platform secret stores. Strip PII from dumps.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 5) Tests & Instrumentation\n    - For any change: add/adjust **unit tests** (pure logic), a **smoke/integration** test (I/O), and one **negative test** for the main failure mode.\n    - For diagnosis: add **temporary counters/logs** (e.g., `console.count`, structured logs). Remove them after verification.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 6) Performance\n    - Keep changes within **baseline complexity**; call out Big-O shifts explicitly.\n    - If perf-sensitive: add a **micro-benchmark** or a reproducible benchmark plan.\n    - Avoid premature optimization; justify tuning with measurements.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 7) Interaction Protocol\n    - Ask **‚â§2 targeted questions** only if blocked. Otherwise proceed with **stated assumptions** + **verification plan**.\n    - Treat explicit user constraints (stack, auth, hosting, CI) as **facts**.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 8) Run & Verify Before Finishing\n    Run what applies (skip gracefully if absent):\n    \n    - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `npm|pnpm|yarn run typecheck`, `test -s`, `lint -s`, `build -s`\n    - **Python**: `pytest -q`; `ruff`/`flake8`; `mypy` if configured\n    - **Go**: `go vet ./... && go test ./...`\n    - **Rust**: `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test`\n    \n    On any failure: **stop** and return a plan with doc links.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 9) Docs & Migrations\n    - For non-trivial changes, update or create:\n      - `README`/`CONTRIBUTING` (run/test/build)\n      - `MIGRATION.md` (breaks, one-shots, rollback steps)\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 10) Safety Rails\n    - **Never** commit secrets/keys or undisclosed prod URLs.\n    - **Never** run destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `DROP`, force-push) without explicit consent + rollback plan.\n    - **Never** fabricate benchmarks, logs, or citations.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 11) Output Formats (to reduce back-and-forth)\n    - **Sanity check:** Verdict; What‚Äôs correct (bullets + doc links); What‚Äôs off/uncertain (bullets + doc links); Next steps (checklist).\n    - **Investigation brief:** Task; Environment; Questions; Where to look (paths); Instrumentation; Deliverables; Acceptance criteria; Doc links.\n    - **Implementation plan:** Minimal plan; risks; files/paths; diffs outline; tests; **Acceptance criteria**; **Doc links**.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## 12) Required Checks (agent must run, where applicable)\n    - All tests/typechecks/lints pass (¬ß8).\n    - Plan/PR includes **official doc links** for each API/tool used.\n    - **Atomicity:** changes are isolated to the planned module; no unintended cross-layer imports/mutations. If `dependency-cruiser`/`knip`/`eslint-plugin-boundaries` are present, run them.\n    - Changes stay within the planned file set (no drive-bys).\n    - If adding a dependency: include official doc link + reason.\n    - If touching auth/crypto/permissions: include a short **threat model**.\n    - **AI change journal** entry created per ¬ß17 and referenced in the summary.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    # 13) MCP Autonomy & Routing (Codex)\n    \n    > Goal: **Auto-select the right MCP/tool for each task**, with minimal prompting, and prove usage via logs/outputs.\n    \n    ## 13.1 Routing Rules (high-level)\n    - **Documentation / ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the correct API?‚Äù** ‚Üí **Context7**.  \n      Fallback: Playwright to locate official sources, then cite.\n    - **Symbol-aware code search/edits; repo mapping; local file ops** ‚Üí **Serena** (activate project first).\n    - **Website interaction, E2E checks, screenshots/PDFs, form actions** ‚Üí **Playwright MCP**.\n    - **Convex data/functions/logs/env** ‚Üí **Convex MCP**.\n    - **Sentry issues/releases/DSNs/Seer analysis** ‚Üí **Sentry MCP**.\n    - **Git/GitHub** ‚Üí GitHub MCP or local git per plan. *(Do **not** use Sentry for Git.)*\n    \n    ## 13.2 Context7 (up-to-date official docs)\n    - Tools: `resolve-library-id`, `get-library-docs`.  \n    - Pattern: resolve library ‚Üí fetch topic docs ‚Üí cite exact sections.\n    \n    ## 13.3 Serena (symbolic code agent)\n    - **Activate project** once per repo: ‚ÄúActivate the current dir as project using Serena‚Äù.\n    - Discovery: `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_file`, `list_dir`.\n    - Edit: `read_file`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`, `replace_regex`.\n    - Shell (if allowed): run typecheck/tests/lint/build.\n    - **File ops for ¬ß17**: create dirs/files, ensure no overwrite; see ¬ß17.3.\n    \n    ## 13.4 Playwright MCP (browser automation)\n    - Navigation: `browser_navigate`, `browser_tab_new/select`, `browser_navigate_back/forward`.\n    - Interact: `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press_key`, `browser_select_option`, `browser_file_upload`.\n    - Evidence: `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_pdf_save`.\n    - Setup: `browser_install` if binaries missing.\n    \n    ## 13.5 Convex MCP\n    - Deployment: `status`.\n    - Data: `tables`, `data` (paginate), `runOneoffQuery` (sandboxed reads).\n    - Functions/logs: `functionSpec`, `run`, `logs`.\n    - Env: `envList`, `envGet`, `envSet`, `envRemove` (destructive ‚Üí require explicit consent + rollback).\n    \n    ## 13.6 Sentry MCP\n    - Org/projects/teams; issues; DSNs; releases; perf; Seer.  \n    - Not for Git or deploys.

I think this project has big potential to become even more popular, as Codex CLI usage grows now with the popularity of GPT-5, those who moved from Claude Code as a main coding CLI would definatelly appreciate the multi-terminal collaborative work. So for this reason I also believe having a unique name would help the project grow.\n\nMultiCode, MultiCodex, DualCode, DualCodex, CollabCodex could be potential names, but I think you should open up a naming suggestion initiative on the github main page, gather name suggestions, make a poll maybe. It's also important to remember it's still Codex at base - other forks chose to name like OpenCodex, AnonCodex, AnythingCodex so I think it's very important to keep the Codex name. But it's also very important to have something in the name to reveal it's about multi terminal / collaborative multi AI agents workflow.\n\nOther CLI allow for switching to another AI agent, but yours is special in that it can use 4 agents talking to each other - and does so locally by literally using the CLIs installed on the device.\n\nAlso a mention - apart from Claude Code and Gemini, I also have Qwen Coder CLI and it's correctly detected and used by Code, but I don't see any mention of Qwen on Code's github page, I think this could be mentioned there like compatible CLI tools.\n\nNot sure if a question or feature request, but for the user it's not clear which kind of AI model is actually being used in each of the Gemini/Claude/Qwen CLIs - is it Sonnet or Opus? Does it respect the reasoning set in Code or is that only applicable to the GPT-5 inside Codex?\n\nAlso, are there any other CLI tools supported, or even CLI tools that can run any custom models? ie: Grok CLI, OpenCode/Charm with any agent?\n\nI couldn't find any mentions of auto-updating (for example Claude Code autoupdates itself, while Codex atleast checks for new updates and notifies the user at start) - anything on this part that the users should know?","score":1,"author":"alexpopescu801","created":1758197951},{"id":"nezj3t6","parentId":"nevibdd","postId":"1ng46rw","depth":6,"text":"Thanks for the thoughtful feedback and suggestions!\n\n\n\nNaming is always tricky.

Opening a naming poll in a GitHub discussion is a good idea ‚Äì feel free to start one!\n\n\n\nAt the moment the CLI auto‚Äëdetects Claude Code, Gemini Code and ChatGPT Code (GPT‚Äë5) because those are the most stable and widely accessible. It will pick up other CLIs you have installed, so Qwen Coder should work even if it isn‚Äôt highlighted in the README. Support for Grok/OpenCode and other custom models is on our radar; you can already experiment with open‚Äësource models via the \\`--oss\\` flag and by integrating Model Context Protocol servers.\n\n\n\nRegarding which model is being used: Code simply defers to each provider's CLI. Claude Code defaults to Opus unless you override it with \\`--model\\`, Gemini CLI uses its Pro model, and GPT‚Äë5 is used for ChatGPT. The reasoning level you set in Code influences the prompts for GPT‚Äë5; the other agents have their own flags, so we‚Äôll document those better.\n\n\n\nYou're also right about auto‚Äëupdates. Claude Code updates itself; Code currently just notifies you when a new version is available so you can choose when to update.

GPT-5 is so good that I'm now convinced that it performs far better than Opus 4.1, so I decided to break up with Claude Code.\n\nTo give you context, I used CC and Codex to write code for Testfully. The front-end is about 400K lines of code in Typescript (React), and the backend is about 200K lines of code in Golang.\n\nI made the switch because:\n\n1. Codex (GPT-5) follows the instructions better, honours the existing coding style and follows it for most cases. With CC, it was constant micro-management to get Opus to follow the existing patterns.\n2. To me, Codex feels like a pragmatic software engineer and does the best to do the task with the minimum number of changes.\n\nTo me, that's enough to make the switch. That said, Codex is not perfect and has shortcomings. Here are some of them:\n\n1. I use the VSCode extension, and the user experience could be better; it's behind Claude Code CLI. I'm yet to try out Codex CLI to see if the UX improves.\n2. The VSCode extension has some weird bugs with tool calling on my setup. It's on my end, or the extension has issues -- something that can be fixed.\n\nI'm paying $20 USD to OpenAI, whereas I was paying $200 USD to Claude, and I'm yet to receive a warning about usage.\n\nFor now, I'm switching to Codex.

Unlike Claude which focuses on reasoning and conversation, Grok is built specifically for speed and real-time code generation. Key differences I noticed:\n\n\n\n\\- Faster response times (usually under 2 seconds vs Claude's 5-8 seconds)\n\n\\- Real-time training data (vs Claude's knowledge cutoff)\n\n\\- More aggressive code completion suggestions\n\n\\- Built-in integration with popular frameworks\n\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n\n1. Speed is genuinely impressive - code suggestions appear almost instantly\n\n2. Context awareness across multiple files in a project\n\n3. Decent at debugging and explaining existing code\n\n4. Handles modern JS/Python frameworks well\n\n5. Built-in Git integration for version control\n\n\n\nReal-world Testing:\n\n\n\nI ran both through the same React component refactoring task:\n\n\\- Grok: Generated working code in 15 seconds, needed minor tweaks\n\n\\- Claude: Took 45 seconds, but code was more thoughtful and included error handling\n\n\n\nFor a Python data processing script:\n\n\\- Grok: Fast but missed edge cases\n\n\\- Claude: Slower but included proper error handling and documentation\n\n\n\nComparison with Claude:\n\n\n\nGrok wins on:\n\n\\- Pure speed\n\n\\- Framework-specific knowledge\n\n\\- Integration features\n\n\n\nClaude wins on:\n\n\\- Code quality and best practices\n\n\\- Complex problem-solving\n\n\\- Explaining WHY something works\n\n\\- Handling edge cases\n\n\n\nPricing is interesting - Grok is about 40% cheaper than Claude Pro but doesn't have the same depth for complex architectural decisions.\n\n\n\nBottom line: Grok feels like a really good autocomplete on steroids. Great for rapid prototyping and routine coding tasks. Claude still better for anything requiring deeper reasoning or when you need to understand complex codebases.\n\n\n\nAnyone else tried it yet? Curious what workflows you're finding it useful for - seems like it could pair well with Claude rather than replace it entirely.","score":63,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1n32scp/tried_grok_code_fast_1_heres_how_it_stacks_up/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1n32scp/tried_grok_code_fast_1_heres_how_it_stacks_up/","author":"No_Extension1000","created":1756459880,"numComments":86,"comments":[{"id":"nbac5pe","parentId":null,"postId":"1n32scp","depth":0,"text":"I don't need speed, I need depth and sound architectural decisions.","score":50,"author":"crystalpeaks25","created":1756460124},{"id":"nbbzfv9","parentId":"nbac5pe","postId":"1n32scp","depth":1,"text":"I'm picturing a car salesman:\n\n \"bro, it's faster than anything else out there!\"\n\n\"What about steering, brakes, and handling?\"\n\n\"Gah, those are just the competitors' bells and whistles.

So I tried it and went with it.  No authorization just started.\n\nI have to tell you it works quite well.  None of this spinning in circles for 30 minutes. You don't need 50 different agents to get what you need.  Open code is separated from the back end API so you don't really have to worry about anything.  They have some type of clever markdown front end where things are colorized and flow better you can use Mouse scroll or page up and down it has session tracking it has session compaction and recall.  has /init\n\nIt's really hitting on all cylinders for me.  There's occasionally an API hiccup where you simply type 'retry' and it picks up again.\n\nIf it reminds me of Claude code maybe two months ago when you head to fool around with a little bit before it became solid 100 percent.\n\nI got rid of all my cursor and windsurf Ides to stick with VSC and TUIs.\n\nI'm a fan.  It has an inline diff scroller so you can see the changes as it works.  You don't have to test prompt and go to sleep for 15 minutes and review what it got wrong.  It just hits it as it works for edit edit edit Bam Bam Bam straight through as you work.  Speed. Then it compiles then it tests then it fixes and then it edits again,  this is native.\n\nIt doesn't have all that ' you're the best you are super awesome this is enterprise software this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, then half filled with mocking and fake data and random BS.\n\nOpenCode shows the context window percentage on the top and the initial command has a sticky so you can keep track of your context window in real time and be 100% okay with compacting or clearing, there is no guessing there is no confusion, it picks up the models context window and particulars automatically.\n\nOut of all the things I've tried OpenCode and Grok Fast is the closest thing I have found yet to pull me away from CC.  Even if I go direct pricing, it's still Bonkers cheap.  My Claude Max5 is $100 which is $6/day and you will get nowhere near that with this - and this one feels better to me.\n\n  \n\\*edit\\*\n\nRan into a brick wall once you get past it's existing body of knowledge.

I didn't every ask for a full send.  we were still in testing AND it had a TODO written to fs to checklist on.  I couldn't even ESC to stop it, OpenCode doesn't process ESC like Claude Code does.  I had to emergency reboot the dev server to stop the 5 or 6 python scripts burning paid API calls.  \n\nMaybe next month kids!  \n\nLike when gpt4.1 or .5 or whatever, RMed a full dir before checking what was in it.

{"postId":"1nj9p4d","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Very bad experience with Codex, now going back to CC","selftext":"To be clear, I don't usually vibe code. I'll still use AI-powered autocomplete for critical parts. \"Vibe coding\" for me means using it on either easy parts I feel I can trust the AI with, or on parts where I want to roll the dice for a new idea.\n\nI've been using Claude Code for a few months. I saw the buzz around Codex/GPT-5 and spent a few weeks evaluating both in the background. I use GPT-5 through my Windsurf subscription. The tests I ran were hard tasks that required smart refactoring or thoughtful investigation. GPT-5 beat CC in most of my tests, and one of them totally convinced me to jump ship.\n\nThree days ago, I made the switch with high confidence. I canceled my CC subscription and signed up for OpenAI. Very quickly, reality hit me. I started using Codex on a big new feature. I created a plan and started executing as I normally would with Claude. Unlike CC, I have to manually change the mode. However, I found that the planning and execution flow isn't smooth with Codex. It still re-reads files to get context even after I approve the plan. When it starts to execute, I'm completely blind to the process, which is something I can easily see with CC. I could see that even though the to-do [li.st](http://li.st) is short, it has a very long series of actions. Sometimes, it edited a file, thought again, and edited the file again. Many of those steps do not make sense to me. After a while, Codex just dumps a large chunk of new code on me, and I have no idea where to even begin reviewing and evaluating it. The code review UX is also terrible. The more tasks I gave it, the lower my confidence and control became. Codex also struggled with using some command-line tools, not as smoothly as CC.\n\nI just canceled my Codex subscription and am going back to CC.\n\nMy Takeaways:\n\n\\* Codex is great for bug-solving and coding-challenge-like problems.\n\n\\* Codex's UX is nowhere near what CC offers.\n\n\\* As a senior dev, I'd prefer a junior who can communicate clearly about what he will do and while he's doing it, over a smart one who just disappears and gets back with a bunch of code without so much context.\n\nWhat do you all think?","score":26,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nj9p4d/very_bad_experience_with_codex_now_going_back_to/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nj9p4d/very_bad_experience_with_codex_now_going_back_to/","author":"biendltb","created":1758105900,"numComments":59,"comments":[{"id":"neolbc4","parentId":null,"postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":0,"text":"oh shit here we go again or migration of tribes choice one","score":31,"author":"Thick-Specialist-495","created":1758106162},{"id":"neox1gm","parentId":"neolbc4","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":1,"text":"Yeah seriously, first we had to suffer a month of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving‚Äù posts, now we have to suffer from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back!!‚Äù posts?!","score":15,"author":"stingraycharles","created":1758111151},{"id":"neps00l","parentId":"neox1gm","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":2,"text":"that is why i'm leaving this subreddit forever for /r/ChatGPT","score":3,"author":"rq60","created":1758121161},{"id":"neps68d","parentId":"neps00l","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":3,"text":"I assume this was a /s ?","score":1,"author":"stingraycharles","created":1758121210},{"id":"nepsad4","parentId":"neps68d","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":4,"text":"you assume correctly","score":1,"author":"rq60","created":1758121242},{"id":"neqb500","parentId":"neox1gm","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":2,"text":"‚ÄúNever left, biatchhh!‚Äù","score":1,"author":"zirouk","created":1758126744},{"id":"nepk38h","parentId":"neolbc4","postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":1,"text":"It's been happening on all the subs ever since vibe coding became a thing.","score":2,"author":"Anrx","created":1758118863},{"id":"nep3miq","parentId":null,"postId":"1nj9p4d","depth":0,"text":"Senior SW engineer (20+ years of experience).

Cleaner React/Tailwind, fewer regressions when I ask for micro-changes, and better at carrying context across iterations. Creative/UI suggestions looked usable rather than generic. Explanations were concise and actually mapped to the diff.\n* **GPT-5-Codex (High):** Struggled with tiny frontend changes (miswired handlers, broken prop names, layout shifts). Creative solutions tended to be bland or visually unbalanced. More retries needed to reach a polished result.\n\nFor me, **Claude is once again the recommendation**‚Äîvery close to how it felt \\~4 weeks ago.

{"postId":"1munpys","subreddit":"ChatGPTPro","title":"Claude Code vs Codex (web/CLI) vs Aider vs CodeAlive - how I actually use each","selftext":"Lately I‚Äôve been bouncing between Claude Code, Aider, Codex, and Codex CLI. Claude Code feels like the current ‚Äúdefault‚Äù for AI coding (Cursor replacement for a lot of folks), but the other tools have more niche sweet spots. Here‚Äôs my workflow and when I reach for each.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* **Claude Code**: my baseline coding agent.\n* **Aider**: great when I know exactly which files matter or I need to apply a planned patch.\n* **Codex CLI**: not the best all-around agent yet, but a lifesaver on gnarly bugs/algorithms (I use high-reasoning mode).\n* **Codex (web)**: exploratory troubleshooting with multiple candidate solution paths.\n* **CodeAlive**: fast understanding of big codebases (50k+ LOC) and solid, accurate diagrams.\n\n# Aider\n\nBased on **Gemini 2.5 Pro**. I use it when I‚Äôm 100% sure which files are relevant‚Äîjust stuff those into Aider‚Äôs context and it will actually consider all of them. Another nice use case: applying a change plan (e.g., from CodeAlive). Aider is excellent at taking a patch plan and updating the specified files accordingly.\n\n# Codex CLI\n\nAs an agent, **Codex CLI** still feels a bit rough compared to Claude Code. But because it now runs on **GPT-5**, I use it **surgically** for the hard parts: feral bugs that Claude Sonnet/Opus (even in ultrathink) can‚Äôt crack, or dense algorithms with tons of edge cases.\n\n**Real example:** In our Nuxt front-end (CodeAlive), we wanted to auto-fill the ‚ÄúName‚Äù field from a pasted repo URL when a user adds a repo‚Äîsounds like a 30-second task, right? For reasons I still don‚Äôt fully get (I‚Äôm not a front-ender), neither Claude Code, Gemini CLI, nor Junie could make it work. Even **Claude Opus 4.1** in ultrathink burned **$10** and didn‚Äôt fix it.\n\n**Codex CLI** in **high reasoning effort** mode did:\n\n    codex --config model_reasoning_effort=\"high\"\n\nPrompt:\n\n    `Name` auto-fill logic is not working - it's extremely complicated problem, since even a Senior dev couldn't solve it. So, think hard to find the root cause and fix it. You can even come up with an alternative approach.\n\nSo if your usual agents stall out, try Codex CLI with high reasoning. Bonus: it now works on **ChatGPT Plus**, not just via API keys.\n\n# Codex (web)\n\nI use **Codex in the browser** when I don‚Äôt even know where to start‚Äîthink ‚Äúpossible OOM root causes.‚Äù The killer feature is that it can propose **up to four solution trajectories** and let you pick the most plausible one.\n\n# CodeAlive\n\nThis is my go-to when I need to quickly understand how something works in a **50k+ LOC** codebase, or when I need **clean, accurate visualizations** (we spent a lot of time making sure diagrams are correct). It gives **precise, deep answers in seconds**, instead of the minutes many code agents need just to assemble context.\n\n# Claude Code\n\nIt‚Äôs still my **default** for day-to-day coding. But when the problem gets weird or the codebase gets huge, I swap in the tools above as needed.\n\nYMMV, but that‚Äôs how I split the work. Curious how others are dividing tasks across these tools -what‚Äôs your mix?","score":6,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1munpys/claude_code_vs_codex_webcli_vs_aider_vs_codealive/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1munpys/claude_code_vs_codex_webcli_vs_aider_vs_codealive/","author":"rodion-m","created":1755621693,"numComments":11,"comments":[{"id":"n9k1raw","parentId":null,"postId":"1munpys","depth":0,"text":"u/rodion-m, there weren‚Äôt enough community votes to determine your post‚Äôs quality.  \nIt will remain for moderator review or until more votes are cast.","score":1,"author":"qualityvote2","created":1755621695},{"id":"n9lgwsn","parentId":null,"postId":"1munpys","depth":0,"text":"Good shit man, gonna try your workflow out, thanks!","score":2,"author":"TangoRango808","created":1755636241},{"id":"n9ndy6r","parentId":"n9lgwsn","postId":"1munpys","depth":1,"text":"Welcome","score":1,"author":"rodion-m","created":1755659402},{"id":"n9lis77","parentId":null,"postId":"1munpys","depth":0,"text":"How much you paying / month to run all of these?","score":1,"author":"notleave_eu","created":1755636773},{"id":"n9ndwmz","parentId":"n9lis77","postId":"1munpys","depth":1,"text":"I use all this stuff, but not full time - so, for CC for me a 20$ subscription is enough, Codex a part of ChatGPT Plus for 20$, CodeAlive 15$","score":1,"author":"rodion-m","created":1755659385},{"id":"n9xmkz9","parentId":null,"postId":"1munpys","depth":0,"text":"Have you tried using Codex in MCP mode?

Instead of 10‚Äì30% better performance like a new model version, agentic setups can deliver 10‚Äì30√ó improvements on some tasks.\n\t‚Ä¢\tModel quality sets a performance ceiling.

{"postId":"1n0h2p0","subreddit":"ChatGPTPro","title":"Claude Code --> switching to GPT5-Pro + Repoprompt + Codex CLI","selftext":"So this isn't -perfect- and Claude Code still has a lot of usability advantages and QoL stuff that's just plain awkward in Codex CLI, but, is that worth a full Claude plan? I've been practicing using the following flow and it's working better and better. Not perfect, but if OpenAI catch up on some CC features it will get there >>\n\n\\#1 - Using GPT-5 Pro as Orchestrator/Assessor (using Repoprompt to package up) -- requires reduction in codebase size and better organisation to work well, but that's good! --->  \nI used RepoPrompt a lot in the Gemini 2.5 Pro dominance era to package up my whole codebase for analysis, but i'm finding it useful now to debug or improve code quality to package up relevant parts of the code and send to GPT5-Pro instead. It has a limit of somewhere between 64KB-69KB that the window will tolerate in web view that I hope they increase, but this has actually led to an improvement in some of my code quality over time -- it's given me a reason to spend time working to reduce the amount of code while retaining UX/functionality, and increase the readability of the code in the process. I'm now purposefully trying to get key separate concerns in my codebase to fit within this amount in order to help with prompting, and it's led to a lot of improvements in the process. \n\n\\#2 - GPT5-Pro to solve bugs and problems other things can't  --->  \nOpus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, regular GPT models, Claude Code, Codex CLI -- all of them get stuck on certain issues that GPT5-Pro solves completely and incisively. I wouldn't use GPT5-Pro for quick experiments or for the mid-point of creating certain features, but to assess the groundwork for a plan or to check in on why something is hard to fix, GPT5-Pro spends a few minutes doing it while you grab a cup of coffee and its solution is usually correct (or at least, even in the rare instances it's not the complete story, it rarely hurts, which is more than can be said for some Claude fixes). I've been using it for very deliberate foundational refactoring on a project to make sure everything's good before I continue. \n\n\\#3 - Main reason I'm enjoying Codex -- it doesn't do the wackily unnecessary list of 'enhancements' that Claude spews out --->  \nI loved Claude Code for the longest time, but why the hell was it trying to put half the crap in that it was trying to put in without asking?? Codex is far less nuts in its behaviour. If I were Anthropic ,that's something I'd try and tweak, or at least give us some control over. \n\n\\#4 - The way to run Codex -->   \ncodex --config model\\_reasoning\\_effort=\"high\"  \nThat will get you the best model if you're on the Pro Plan, and I've not encountered a single rate limit. No doubt they'll enshittify it at some point, but I'm fairly flexible about jumping between the three major AI tools based on their development so, we'll see!\n\n\\#5 - Using the rest of the GPT5-Pro context window when done -->  \nIf you're keeping a lot of your requests below 65KB ish, when you're done with all the changes, get Codex to create a mini list of files altered and what was altered and why etc, especially any discrepancies vs the original plan. Then, copy that into Repoprompt and send a query through to the same Pro chat, asking --- \"The codebase has now been altered with the following change notes. Please assess whether the new set of files is as you expected it to be, and give any guidance for further adjustments and tweaks as needed\". If you're low on context or want a greater focus, you can just do the actual changed files (if you committed prior to the changes, repoprompt even lets you include the git diffs and their files alone). Now, sometimes Pro gets slightly caught up on thinking it has to say stuff here for suggestions just so it felt like it did its job and is a good boy, etc, but often it will catch some small elements that the codex implementations missed or got wrong, and you just paste that back through to Codex.\n\n\\#6 - when relaying between agents such as Codex and the main GPT-5 pro (or indeed, any multi-llm stuff), I still use tags like -- <AGENT></AGENT> or <PROPOSAL></PROPOSAL> -- i.e. 'Another agent has given the following proposals for X Y Z features. Trace the relevant code and read particularly affected files in full, make sure you understand what it is asking for, and then outline your plan for implementation -- <PROPOSAL>copied-text-from-gpt-5-pro-here</PROPOSAL>' -- I have no idea how useful this is, but I think as those messages can be quite long and agents prone to confusion, it helps just make that crystal clear. \n\n  \nAnyway, I hope the above is of some use to people, and if you have any of your own recommendations for such a flow, let me know!\n\n","score":9,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1n0h2p0/claude_code_switching_to_gpt5pro_repoprompt_codex/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1n0h2p0/claude_code_switching_to_gpt5pro_repoprompt_codex/","author":"ImaginaryAbility125","created":1756200118,"numComments":8,"comments":[{"id":"naqfgkt","parentId":null,"postId":"1n0h2p0","depth":0,"text":"u/ImaginaryAbility125, there weren‚Äôt enough community votes to determine your post‚Äôs quality.  \nIt will remain for moderator review or until more votes are cast.","score":1,"author":"qualityvote2","created":1756200120},{"id":"naqw0oy","parentId":null,"postId":"1n0h2p0","depth":0,"text":"What enhancements is Claude adding if you‚Äôre feeding it specific prompts from the orchestrator?\n\nDoesn‚Äôt that break the problem down into specific steps and changes to implement?\n\nDo you use an instruction set or MCP server for added clarity?","score":2,"author":"MR_PRESIDENT__","created":1756208251},{"id":"narpddj","parentId":"naqw0oy","postId":"1n0h2p0","depth":1,"text":"Well I‚Äôm using Codex rather than Claude ‚Äî it does break things down and do its own checking, but it does so with the path completely laid out for it, amending all as needed and agentically running linting, type check, test suite, doing little adjustments at the end all as needed and so on ‚Äî all very useful","score":1,"author":"ImaginaryAbility125","created":1756218151},{"id":"naruhdw","parentId":"narpddj","postId":"1n0h2p0","depth":2,"text":"Would be interesting to see which gives better adjustments if you fed both models the same testing framework.\n\nSomething like [this](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)","score":1,"author":"MR_PRESIDENT__","created":1756219623},{"id":"naros8i","parentId":null,"postId":"1n0h2p0","depth":0,"text":"Does pro take too longer to answer for you compared to thinking?

I regret everything.","selftext":"I‚Äôve been an Anthropic evangelist for the past year. As a developer, Claude Code's huge context window and its almost \"thoughtful\" way of handling complex code architecture was a total game-changer. It felt less like a tool and more like a true pair programmer. I was the guy telling everyone in my circle to switch.\n\nThen the GPT-5 hype train arrived. Everyone at work was buzzing about the new unified system, the exclusive \"GPT-5 Pro\" model, and the supposed \"agentic\" coding powers. The FOMO was real, so I caved and bought a Pro subscription to see what I was missing.\n\nTurns out what I was missing was a masterclass in frustration.\n\nThe so-called \"state-of-the-art\" coding is a joke. I gave it a multi-file debugging task that Claude Code handles gracefully. GPT-5 hallucinated functions that don't exist, got confused between which file was which, and then capped it off with a generic, \"As a large language model...\" non-answer. Its suggestions are lazy and superficial, always defaulting to the most obvious, boilerplate solution instead of actually understanding the nuance of the codebase.\n\nThis feels exactly like the \"enshittification\" everyone complained about with GPT-4o. It seems they've optimized for speed and generic \"helpfulness\" at the expense of deep, actual reasoning. It just can't hold complexity. What's the point of a massive context window if the model's effective memory can't even track three open files in a simple project?\n\nI'm genuinely baffled by the positive reviews. Is anyone else who made the switch from Claude having this experience? Or is there some secret \"don't be a useless assistant\" prompt I'm supposed to know about?\n\nFor now, I'm canceling my sub and running back to the model that actually works.","score":92,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1muarc6/i_ditched_claude_code_for_gpt5_to_improve_my/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1muarc6/i_ditched_claude_code_for_gpt5_to_improve_my/","author":"Connect-Soil-7277","created":1755584981,"numComments":81,"comments":[{"id":"n9hidbb","parentId":null,"postId":"1muarc6","depth":0,"text":"‚úÖ u/Connect-Soil-7277, your post has been approved by the community!  \nThanks for contributing to r/ChatGPTPro ‚Äî we look forward to the discussion.","score":1,"author":"qualityvote2","created":1755584982},{"id":"n9hsxw3","parentId":null,"postId":"1muarc6","depth":0,"text":"‚ÄúTurns out what I was missing was a masterclass in frustration.‚Äù - well hello there little AI","score":56,"author":"Commercial_Slip_3903","created":1755591235},{"id":"n9i6ynr","parentId":"n9hsxw3","postId":"1muarc6","depth":1,"text":"Give them credit, at least they polished out the em-dashes","score":23,"author":"ClickF0rDick","created":1755599344},{"id":"n9oyrsi","parentId":"n9i6ynr","postId":"1muarc6","depth":2,"text":"Seriously why is it so em dash happy now?\n\n\nIt‚Äôs annoying how it does it ‚Äîall the fucking time‚Äî when rewriting stuff for me.","score":2,"author":"Big_Cornbread","created":1755689020},{"id":"n9mip0u","parentId":"n9i6ynr","postId":"1muarc6","depth":2,"text":"Lmao ü§£","score":1,"author":"UsedTableSalt","created":1755648322},{"id":"n9ieo14","parentId":"n9hsxw3","postId":"1muarc6","depth":1,"text":"Convince me that you aren't AI yourself.

{"postId":"1nqvcr6","subreddit":"codex","title":"My one-day deep dive on Codex vs. Claude Code vs. Cursor","selftext":"I spent the whole day deep-diving into Codex, and I'm seriously impressed. It genuinely feels like there‚Äôs a senior engineer behind the model. It gives you the sense that it's actually reading and understanding your code, not just running a glorified \\`grep\\` to find keywords and summarize them.\n\nFor instance, when I asked it to map out a plan for a new feature, it pointed to specific logic within a specific file, explained its purpose, and then laid out Options A, B, and C. It even added priorities, telling me which part to build first and which was optional. When it comes to pure programming, my gut feeling right now is that Codex \"gets\" coding the most.\n\nThis experience helped me form an initial mental model for these tools:\n\n**1. For Hardcore Programming:**\n\n\\- Codex is absolutely professional-grade. The strategies it suggests are built on a solid architectural mindset.\n\n\\- Cursor, by comparison, is more general-purpose. It's incredibly flexible if you know its tricks, and it's definitely more beginner-friendly.\n\n**2. For Tooling and Broader Workflows:**\n\n\\- Claude Code's main strength is its powerful Agent and toolchain ecosystem. The potential here is massive; its entire philosophy seems to be \"enhancing AI programming through tools.\"\n\n\\- Cursor also provides convenient plugins, but it relies more on the user to extend its capabilities.\n\n**Core Conclusion**\n\nThis leads me to a fundamental distinction in their approach:\n\n\\- Codex feels like: (Core Coding Model) + Agent. It starts with an extremely deep understanding of code, and then uses an Agent to execute tasks based on that understanding.\n\n\\- Claude Code feels like: (Core Agent) + Coding Ability. Its foundation is the Agent, which accomplishes tasks by calling on a variety of tools, one of which happens to be programming.\n\n**TL;DR Recommendation**\n\n\\- If you're after the purest, most hardcore coding experience, Codex seems to be the most powerful all-around choice right now.\n\n\\- If your workflow extends beyond just coding and you need powerful tool integration, Claude Code is your best bet.\n\n\\- Cursor sits nicely in the middle. It has the widest coverage and is probably the best entry point for most people.","score":29,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1nqvcr6/my_oneday_deep_dive_on_codex_vs_claude_code_vs/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1nqvcr6/my_oneday_deep_dive_on_codex_vs_claude_code_vs/","author":"Straight-Pace-4945","created":1758873176,"numComments":30,"comments":[{"id":"ngabc0h","parentId":null,"postId":"1nqvcr6","depth":0,"text":"Codex is so damn good.

{"postId":"1o65jva","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Understanding Claude Code's 3 system prompt methods (Output Styles, --append-system-prompt, --system-prompt)","selftext":"Uhh, hello there. Not sure I've made a new post that wasn't a comment on Reddit in over a decade, but I've been using Claude Code for a while now and have learned a lot of things, mostly through painful trial and error:\n\n- Days digging through docs\n- Deep research with and without AI assistance\n- Reading decompiled Claude Code source\n- Learning a LOT about how LLMs function, especially coding agents like CC, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Cursor, etc.\n\nAnyway I ramble, I'll try to keep on-track.\n\n## What This Post Covers\n\nA lot of people don't know what it really means to use --append-system-prompt or to use output styles. Here's what I'm going to break down:\n\n- Exactly what is in the Claude Code system prompt for v2.0.14\n- What output styles replace in the system prompt\n- Where the instructions from --append-system-prompt go in your system prompt\n- What the new --system-prompt flag does and how I discovered it\n- Some of the techniques I find success with\n\nThis post is written by me and lightly edited (heavily re-organized) by Claude, otherwise I will ramble forever from topic to topic and make forever run-on sentences with an unholy number of commas because I have ADHD and that's how my stream of consciousness works. I will append an LLM-generated TL;DR to the bottom or top or somewhere for those of you who are already fed up with me.\n\n## How I Got This Information\n\nThe following system prompts were acquired using my fork of the cchistory repository:\n\n- **Original repo:** https://github.com/badlogic/cchistory (broken since October 5th, stopped at v2.0.5)\n- **Original diff site:** https://cchistory.mariozechner.at/\n- **My working fork:** https://github.com/AnExiledDev/cchistory/commit/1466439fa420aed407255a54fef4038f8f80ec71\n  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Grab from main at your own peril, I am planning a rewrite so it isn't just a monolithic index.js; then write full unit tests\n  - You need to set output style in settings.json (in .claude) to test output styles if using my fork, possibly using the custom binary flag as well\n\n## The Claude Code System Prompt Breakdown\n\nLet's start with the Claude Code System Prompt. I've used cchistory to generate the system prompt here: https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/cdef0dd5f216d5eb50fca12256a91b4d\n\nLot of BS in there and most of it is untouchable unless you use the Claude Agent SDK, but that's a rant for another time.\n\n## Output Styles: What Changes\n\nI generated three versions to show you exactly what's happening:\n\n1. **With an output style:** https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/b51fa3c215ee8867368fdae02eb89a04\n2. **With --append-system-prompt:** https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/86e6895336348bfdeebe4ba50bce6470\n3. **Side-by-side diff:** https://www.diffchecker.com/LJSYvHI2/\n\n**Key differences when you use an output style:**\n\n- Line 18 changes to mention the output style below, specifically calling out to \"help users according to your 'Output Style'\" and \"how you should respond to user queries.\"\n\n- The \"## Tone and style\" header is removed entirely. These instructions are pretty light. HOWEVER, there are some important things you will want to preserve if you continue to use Claude Code for development:\n\n  - Sections relating to erroneous file creation\n  - Emojis callout\n  - Objectivity\n\n- The \"## Doing tasks\" header is removed as well. This section is largely useless and repetitive. Although do not forget to include similar details in your output style to keep it aligned to the task, however literally anything you write will be superior, if I'm being honest. Anthropic needs to do better here...\n\n- The \"## Output Style: Test Output Style\" header exists now! The \"Test Output Style\" is the name of my output style I used to generate this. What is below the header is exactly as I have in my test output style.\n\n**Important placement note:** You might notice the output style is directly above the tools definition, which since the tools definitions are a disorganized, poorly written, bloated mess, this is actually closer to the start of the system prompt than the end.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n- LLMs maintain context best from the start and ending of a large prompt\n- Since these instructions are relatively close to the start, adherence is quite solid in my experience, even with context windows larger than >180k tokens\n- However, I found instruction adherence to begin to degrade after >120k tokens, sometimes as early as >80k tokens in the context\n\n## --append-system-prompt: Where It Goes\n\nNow if you look at the --append-system-prompt example we see once again, this is appended DIRECTLY above the tools definitions.\n\n**If you use both:**\n\n- Output style is placed above the appended system prompt\n\n**Pro tip:** In my VSC devcontainer, I have it configured to create a Claude command alias to append a specific file to the system prompt upon launch. (Simplified the script so you can use it too: https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/ea1ac2b744737dcf008f581033935b23)\n\n## Discovering the --system-prompt Flag (v2.0.14)\n\nNow, primarily the reason for why I have chosen today to finally share this information is because v2.0.14's changelog mentions they documented a new flag called \"--system-prompt.\" Now, maybe they documented the code internally, or I don't know the magic word, but as far as I can tell, no they fucking did not.\n\n**Where I looked and came up empty:**\n\n- `claude --help` at the time of writing this\n- Their docs where other flags are documented\n- Their documentation AI said it doesn't exist\n- Couldn't find any info on it anywhere\n\nSo I forked cchistory again since my old fork I had done similar but in a really stupid way so just started over, fixed the critical issues, then set it up to use my existing Claude Code instance instead of downloading a fresh one which satisfied my own feature request from a few months ago which I made before deciding I'd do it myself. This is how I was able to test and document the --system-prompt flag.\n\nWhat --system-prompt actually does:\n\nThe --system-prompt flag finally added SOME of what I've been bitching about for a while. This flag replaces the entire system prompt except:\n\n- The bloated tool definitions (I get why, but I BEG you Anthropic, let me rewrite them myself, or disable the ones I can just code myself, give me 6 warning prompts I don't care, your tool definitions suck and you should feel bad. :( )\n- A single line: \"You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.\"\n\nExample system prompt using \"--system-prompt '[PINEAPPLE]'\": https://gist.github.com/AnExiledDev/e85ff48952c1e0b4e2fe73fbd560029c\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nClaude Code's system prompt is finally, mostly (if it weren't for the bloated tool definitions, but I digress) customizable!\n\n**The good news:**\n\n- With Anthropic's exceptional instruction hierarchy training and adherence, anything added to the system prompt will actually MOSTLY be followed\n- You have way more control now\n\n**The catch:**\n\n- The real secret to getting the most out of your LLM is walking that thin line of just enough context for the task‚Äînot too much, not too little\n- If you're throwing 10,000 tokens into the system prompt on top of these insane tool definitions (11,438 tokens for JUST tools!!! WTF Anthropic?!) you're going to exacerbate context rot issues\n\n**Bonus resource:**\n\n- **Anthropic token estimator** (actually uses Anthropic's API see https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens): https://claude-tokenizer.vercel.app/\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR (Generated by Claude Code, edited by me)\n\nClaude Code v2.0.14 has three ways to customize system prompts, but they're poorly documented. I reverse-engineered them using a fork of cchistory:\n\n1. Output Styles: Replaces the \"Tone and style\" and \"Doing tasks\" sections. Gets placed near the start of the prompt, above tool definitions, for better adherence. Use this for changing how Claude operates and responds.\n\n2. --append-system-prompt: Adds your instructions right above the tool definitions. Stacks with output styles (output style goes first). Good for adding specific behaviors without replacing existing instructions.\n\n3. --system-prompt (NEW in v2.0.14): Replaces the ENTIRE system prompt except tool definitions and one line about being a Claude agent. This is the nuclear option - gives you almost full control but you're responsible for everything.\n\nAll three inject instructions above the tool definitions (11,438 tokens of bloat). Key insight: LLMs maintain context best at the start and end of prompts, and since tools are so bloated, your custom instructions end up closer to the start than you'd think, which actually helps adherence.\n\nBe careful with token count though - context rot kicks in around 80-120k (my note: technically as early as 8k, but starts to become more of a noticable issue at this point) tokens even though the window is larger. Don't throw 10k tokens into your system prompt on top of the existing bloat or you'll make things worse.\n\nI've documented all three approaches with examples and diffs in the post above. Check the gists for actual system prompt outputs so you can see exactly what changes.\n\n----\n\n[Title Disclaimer: Technically there are other methods, but they don't apply to Claude Code interactive mode.]\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to comment, if you're shy, I'm more than happy to help in DM's but my replies may be slow, apologies.\n","score":32,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o65jva/understanding_claude_codes_3_system_prompt/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o65jva/understanding_claude_codes_3_system_prompt/","author":"CodeMonke_","created":1760414620,"numComments":10,"comments":[{"id":"njedgpt","parentId":null,"postId":"1o65jva","depth":0,"text":"This is quality content.

If you find some instruction being consistently ignored, or having to apply an instruction to every single conversation, adding it to the system prompt ensures stricter adherence to the instructions, as the system prompt is sent with every request.\n\nThe use varies a lot, if you switch the system prompt a lot, output styles might be better. You could have the system prompt modified based on the task you're doing, feeding task specific or project specific knowledge to the system prompt. Granted outside of output styles, this requires a claude code restart to use an updated flag, but all of these work even when resuming a conversation, so you can modify the system prompt mid-conversation. I'm working on something to support this, by injecting relevant memories directly into the system prompt, and in the background I'm restarting claude code with a new system prompt every message, carefully targeted to the specific task.\n\nMy problem a lot of the time is I will tell claude not to create markdown files unless asked, well 80k tokens in this instruction starts getting lost because it was 70k tokens ago, context rot is kicking in, and now its trying to write markdown files. I add the instruction to the system prompt, I don't encounter issues with adherence 95% of the time even above >150k tokens.\n\nYou can add additional context on mcp tool usage, use an output style with writing examples to get it to help you with creative writing tasks while preserving your voice. (Examples are powerful in the system prompt) You can include the filetree if its having consistent navigation issues.\n\nBasically, figure out what claude is failing to do correctly and annoying you, then figure out a prompt snippet to add to the system prompt to prevent it from doing that thing, is one of the main use cases. Remember though, negative instructions often result in seeding it to do the very thing you told it not to, my strategy is to lead every negative instruction with a positive instruction, and avoid strong language, example: \"Favor writing detailed docblocks for all methods, following google's docblock standards, avoid writing incomplete or 'lazy' docblocks and employ the full docblock spec to the greatest extent warranted by the code's complexity.\"\n\nBasically instead of DO x, DON'T y, use FAVOR x, AVOID y.

It follows prompts, does not hallucinate and just works very well for complex backend and systems programming, if you know how to use it properly. It can maintain context for very large codebases and does not \"Get lost\". That's why its my primary driver for serious development now.\n\n**However, it has one flaw, which is front-end and UI/UX. It fucking sucks at this**.\n\nSo i use Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Cursor for front-end and Codex CLI for back-end and systems programming.\n\nI drafted a detailed implementation plan for Claude to create a dashboard.\n\nOn first try, Claude \"followed\" my detailed plan and claimed to create A PRODUCTION READY DASHBOARD !\n\nTypical Claude.\n\nI then asked Codex to review what Claude did and compare it to documentation and design docs. No surprise, CODEX found lots of issues and Claude's hallucinations and inability to follow instructions.\n\nI then gave Claude another set of instructions based on Codex's findings to fix issues found (it was not even building). Claude did.\n\nThen i fed it to Codex again and oops...Claude could not fix all problems with clear instructions from Codex on first try. I then created a second try with remaining bugs for Claude to fix.\n\nIt still failed lol. I had to give 3rd prompt to fix remaining issue.\n\nSo yeah....Claude Sonnet is much faster at writing code than GPT models (even GPT-Codex-Medium), but its terrible with context efficiency and following instructions. You HAVE to babysit it and work back and forth with it.\n\nYou may ask, why do i expect it to work on such big functionality and implement it at once ?\n\nWell, i do that with Codex and it does work like that on my backend engineering and follows plan. It does not claim to have done it in single shot and say its \"PRODUCTION READY\". Instead, it proposes to split the implementation into logical chunks itself and does it incrementally step by step. And on each step it mostly does it flawlessly (at least it builds and tests pass lmao)\n\nSo yeah even if you are hardcore Claude fan you might as well get a 20$ Codex subscription for bugfixes and checking what Claude did.

I've tried Codex and had some success.  Claude Code is the most consistently useful platform for development and the one I've successfully built my primary application plus numerous scripts, tools, and experiments. The CLI beats out Codex by a mile.  Especially now that token usage is on the status line.\n\nYes, yes, yes there's **problems**. Of course. AI-assisted coding overall has a long way to go to realize the dream of just talking to a computer and it magically reads your mind and builds whatever you want.  Yes, you really need to be a developer in some capacity; or some type of engineering skill.  You have to have the logical troubleshooting skills programmers use even though you're not looking directly at the code much of the time.  The same troubleshooting process takes place with AI tools.\n\nOverall, I've learned that what I'm really building is an AI system that builds the application(s) I want. i.e. I'm not using Typescript to program a SaaS app.  I'm using prompts, [claude.md](http://claude.md), scripts, hooks, etc to construct a system that properly creates the app I want.  And the core engine keeps changing requiring adapation on the daily.\n\nOpenSpec has been a game changer. Git Worktrees when using multiple agents. Defining a process in [claude.md](http://claude.md) that tells Claude to maintain status reports, validate requirements, test, and commit even though Claude doesn't always follow it.  All super useful. Definitely looking for better implementation of hooks and scripts to make sure task are implemented (single scripts that find information, validate and test, commit, and more - then just tell Claude in [claude.md](http://claude.md) to execute those single commands in sequence.\n\nThe real game changer may come with clients that use the Claude SDK and implement the software development lifecycle, worktrees, and all the rest that have to go around it - Crystal (u/radial\\_symmetry) , Just Every Code - let me know if there are other options you've discovered.\n\nThanks u/Anthropic!","score":4,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o35s30/happy_with_claude_code/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o35s30/happy_with_claude_code/","author":"jonathanmalkin","created":1760113917,"numComments":8,"comments":[{"id":"nisrsgf","parentId":null,"postId":"1o35s30","depth":0,"text":"Paid Chatbot ?

It handled the design beautifully, with pixel-perfect layouts, proper hierarchy, and clear explanations of each step. I could never have done this lol. But as the project grew, it struggled with smaller details, like schema relations and handling HttpOnly tokens mapped to opaque IDs with TTL/cleanup to prevent spoofing or cross-user issues.\n\n**Observations on GPT-5-codex**\n\nGPT-5 Codex, on the other hand, had a better handling of the situation. It maintained context better, refactored safely, and produced working code almost immediately (though it still had some linter errors like unused variables). It understood file dependencies, handled cross-module logic cleanly, and seemed to ‚Äúget‚Äù the project structure better. The only downside was the developer experience of Codex, the docs are still unclear and there is limited control, but the output quality made up for it.\n\nBoth models still produced long-running queries that would be problematic in a serverless setup. It would‚Äôve been nice if they flagged that upfront, but you still see that architectural choices require a human designer to make final calls. By the end, Codex delivered the entire recommendation engine with fewer retries and far fewer context errors. Claude‚Äôs output looked cleaner on the surface, but Codex‚Äôs results actually held up in production.\n\nClaude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend.\n\n**Cost comparison:**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 + Claude Code: \\~18M input + 117k output tokens, cost around $10.26. Produced more lint errors but UI looked clean.  \nGPT-5 Codex + Codex Agent: \\~600k input + 103k output tokens, cost around $2.50. Fewer errors, clean UI, and better schema handling.\n\nI wrote a full breakdown¬†[Claude 4.5 Sonnet vs GPT-5 Codex](https://composio.dev/blog/claude-sonnet-4-5-vs-gpt-5-codex-best-model-for-agentic-coding),  \nIf anyone wants to see both models in action. also you can find the code results in this¬†[repo.](http://github.com/rohittcodes/fashion-hub)\n\nWould love to hear what others think. Is Claude actually slipping in coding performance, or is GPT-5 Codex just evolving faster than we expected? Also, what‚Äôs the issue with the DX for Codex?\n\n","score":16,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o0im7l/i_tested_claude_45_sonnet_with_cc_and_gpt5_codex/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1o0im7l/i_tested_claude_45_sonnet_with_cc_and_gpt5_codex/","author":"Gullible-Time-8816","created":1759852354,"numComments":6,"comments":[{"id":"ni9pmmt","parentId":null,"postId":"1o0im7l","depth":0,"text":"GPT-5 is a goated model that I've been using for so so long now, and it's currently the best model for almost anything I need.","score":2,"author":"shricodev","created":1759854049},{"id":"ni9k4ko","parentId":null,"postId":"1o0im7l","depth":0,"text":"Thanks for your post about Sonnet 4.5!\n\n**Hot Topic Thread:** We've created a [dedicated discussion thread](https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nvocj2/sonnet_45_issues_bugs/) because to keep the discussion organized and help us track all issues in one place.\n\nPlease share your feedback there - it makes it easier for Anthropic to see the patterns.\n\n---\n\n*This message is automated.

The AI gets exactly the context it needs ‚Äì no more, no less.  Together you create tasks, documentation, coding rules...and they all get indexed and linked together with your code and file based documentation.  While your ai codes, it follows tasks that are created in EXTREME detail and gets intelligent context-relevant rules injected with prompts and during tool usage.\n\n\\*\\*MCP-First Architecture:\\*\\*\n\nThe MCP server is the heart of Felix. AI assistants can:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Semantic search\\*\\* across code, docs, tasks, and rules simultaneously\n\n\\- \\*\\*Multi-level context queries\\*\\*: Get just component IDs, full source + relationships, or deep dependency trees\n\n\\- \\*\\*Relational queries\\*\\*: \"Show me all functions that call X\" or \"Find components related to authentication\"\n\n\\- \\*\\*Smart context generation\\*\\*: Returns code WITH related documentation snippets, applicable rules, and linked notes\n\n\\- \\*\\*Context compacting\\*\\*: Multiple view modes (skeleton, files+lines, full source) to fit token budgets\n\n\\- \\*\\*Lens-based context\\*\\*: Focus on specific relationships (callers, callees, imports, inheritance, data-flow)\n\n\\- \\*\\*Token-budget awareness\\*\\*: Specify max

{"postId":"1nziovg","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"I am disappointed with the limits in Claude even having a MAX plan for $200 and after Codex verification, I will be another person giving up on Claude, details in the description.","selftext":"I have been using Claude code for a long time, practically from the beginning when it was created, and it has completely changed the way I use AI. I don't know so much about code, but since AI is doing well with programming I started creating a couple of applications at the beginning to automate for myself and then streamline things at home. Claude Code, Sonnet 4 and Opus helped me a lot to develop technical skills and thanks to it I have things like automatic opening and closing of blinds or sending alarms when smoke detectors detect something, home lab and smart home is a big area of activities and possibilities.\n\nAlthough there were sometimes limits I used Opus and Sonnet intensively. I didn't complain too much because the limits were sometimes reached at most an hour before the next 5-hour session.\nThings started to break down when weekly limits were introduced. Limits fluctuated terribly, sometimes it was better (but not like before the introduction of weekly limits), sometimes it was so bad that the limits in a 5 hour session ended after 1 hour....\nMy plan didn't change, the way I use it did too.\nThe last 2 weeks have been tragic, because after about 3 days I used up the entire weekend limit.\nIf the Anthropic team says that it does not change the limits then for me it is a simple lie, it is impossible to attract similar habits and use in a similar way so drastically change the limits.\n\nI'll get to the main point, so as not to write too much.\nI've been testing Codex for a week having the usual $20 plan.\n\nFor 4 days I used similarly to Claude codex.... And only at the 4th day I had a limit. And not the cheapest model available just usually used the better ones. Codex has its downsides, but it can all be worked out and set up to achieve better accuracy similar to Claude, although in some cases Codex does better.\n\nI know that OpenAI is probably losing a lot of money on this, and I know that it probably won't last very long, but even if they make it 2 or 3 times worse it will still be better than with Claude, who can with a $200 plan limit access after 1 day. \nChatgpt's $20 plan and even more so the $200 plan is worth the money unlike Claude, which was great in the beginning and has now deteriorated.\n\nAnthropic is going the way of Cursor, and it's not a good way because Cursor blatantly scams people, changes limits every different day and purposely worsens the performance of models through its layer just to make it cheaper.\n\nAt this point I am switching from claude to Codex and will gladly pay them $200 if necessary than $200 claude, which does not want to see its users.\n\nAnd all because of the stupid decision of weekend capping. It was enough to ban forever those who used the limits 24 hours a day all week and overtaxed the resources, and give honest users full freedom, then of course because of some idiots who bragged here and created videos how claude works alone 24 hours a day Anthropic had to give a weekend limit. As far as I'm concerned they seized the moment to limit access to everyone because maintenance was too expensive, and that was just an excuse to implement limits.\n\nSonnet 4.5 will not save the situation, and if it goes on like this, OpenAI will garner more users than Anthropic. \nPersonally, I feel cheated because I pay so much for only 1 day limit without giving any information that the limits are changing.\n\nAnd if not OpenAI, Chinese models are available to choose from at a good price, or even for free \n\nTime to wake up and be competitive.","score":65,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nziovg/i_am_disappointed_with_the_limits_in_claude_even/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nziovg/i_am_disappointed_with_the_limits_in_claude_even/","author":"CacheConqueror","created":1759756359,"numComments":21,"comments":[{"id":"ni2om2c","parentId":null,"postId":"1nziovg","depth":0,"text":"I‚Äôm on Max 20x ($200/month) and I‚Äôve already burned through my entire weekly limit - now I have to wait until Thursday evening just to work again.

Most Pro users can expect 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 within their weekly usage limits.\n\n* This will vary based on factors such as codebase size and user settings like auto-accept mode. Users running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel will hit their limits sooner.\n\n\"\n\nI generally hit 5 hour limits with 1.5-2 hours of medium-heavy work, which is approximately the same as before the 4.5 update, so I do not see 4.5 being faster at consuming tokens than 4.0 according to 5 hour limits.\n\nRight now I am sitting at 3 days 2/3 sessions hitting the limit + sometimes a very small 4th session, let's normalize it to 8 sessions (Generous estimation). I am at 80% weekly usage and yellow \"Approaching weekly limit\" shows up in UI. I usually hit a 5 hour limit in 1.5-2 hours of medium to heavy use, normalize to 2h (again generous).  8\\*2 = 16; 16/8\\*10 (to achieve 100% usage) = \\~20 hours of usage alloted per week. **It is HALF of the MINIMUM range they are providing.**\n\nI do not use parallel or sub-agents, my codebase for the last-few-days project is not very large (about 10k lines frontend and 5k lines backend + a few docs for work organization which I think conserve tokens in the long run rather than spend) and I do not have a lot of mcps, I use CC in a single chat/terminal session. I also generally try to manage context for CC so it doesn't need to read too many files, conserving context so I do not have to run /compact too much (I generally prefer it to a completely new session just because of convenience).\n\nHere are the exact commit line numbers since the start of this week (right after reset) for even more detailed view into this, this includes code changes (including repeated), documentation changes etc.:\n\n     Commits (487cf28..HEAD):\n      - 10,601 insertions(+)\n      - 5,865 deletions(-)\n      - 16,466 total changed lines in commits\n    \n      Current staged changes:\n      - 955 insertions(+)\n      - 29 deletions(-)\n      - 984 total changed lines staged\n    \n      Grand total: 17,450 changed lines\n\n\\+ any reworks inside commits, which there were not a lot. And with current staged changes I also plugged in codex after about 50% because of fear of hitting limits.\n\nThis is absolutely misadvertized, and even worse - changed without any communication AND not addressed in any of their public posts and communication. I do not understand how they can sit silently unless they just want to get rid of their paying users and kill the largest differentiator they have from other AI companies - reliable coding.  \nMy thoughts about changing to. MAX x5 are dead in the water and my next hope is GLM (or other open source models) is at least on the level of 3.7 and suit my workflow.

I signed up for both about four months ago specifically because of Opus - when used as an Agent, opus is the only model that I could rely on to make changes to my production code without constant micromanagement.\n\nOpus would follow instructions in claude.md, and if it ran into issues, would intelligently think through solutions instead of blindly steaming on ahead.\n\nI used opus on one $200 account, and loved it so much I shelled out for a second $200 account - one worked on my mobile app and the other on my backend and web app. I would often approach the five hour limit, and whenever I got that message I would just take a break - using sonnet was just not worth it because I had to tell it exactly what to do to keep it from blindly breaking things.\n\nWell, then they release sonnet 4.5 which IS better than 4.0 - but it makes the same dumb mistakes as the previous sonnet: when it hits a problem it just blindly picks a solution instead of thinking. So I stuck with opus. But I hit my weekly limit on both accounts in less than one day and now I can‚Äôt use it again until October 9.\n\nSo now I‚Äôm back to meticulously micro managing sonnet 4.5. But I‚Äôm wondering: why pay $400/month when I still have to micro? Why not just use $20 codex?\n\nBecause gpt5 is just as smart as opus. I heavily prefer the Claude code user experience and sub agent implementation, but when it comes to making decisions gpt5 is just as smart for 1/10th the cost (I know OpenAI is losing money but for the moment gpt5 is cheap)\n\nI wasn‚Äôt abusing opus - when I hit the limit I opened a second account.

A lot of people just call B.S. because they are either skeptical or ignorant, so they ask for \"proof\" of everything.\n\nI was compelled to make a video of a real, living breathing person (me), running a real business that makes real money, and using AI to write all of the code. You can watch it at [https://youtu.be/NuZHqkOymYI](https://youtu.be/NuZHqkOymYI)\n\nSurely, this still won't be enough for some people, because they just can't see the writing on the wall. But this app will soon run my entire course training business and is currently working with 15,000+ students. Not to mention, my career and livelihood depend on it to run effectively.\n\nAI did NOT take my agency away. Not anyone can do this -- the only reason it worked is because I know how code works and understand how to architect systems and define requirements. I've essentially been a super technical PM/SA for the last 7 or 8 years, and have kinda been out of writing any of the code myself. But Claude Code has reignited my passion for dev, and I'm now finding myself able to build lots of cool things with code very quickly and at a very high level of quality.\n\nThe platform's called Codex (ironically named, but I named it before that \"previous\" company did because I thought it aligned well for my business -- essentially a rolodex of code). And it's running everything new for my company, and was built just about completely with Claude Code + Sonnet/Opus.\n\nI built a full, complete exam-taking system that is super complex, but is exactly what I set out to build. Students can take time exams, get a full detailed breakdown of results, share them with others, etc. The platform should have taken well over a year to build, but all of its functionality as well as the core course platform features were all built in 3 months.\n\nIt feels like I'm coding both more and less at the same time. More because I'm constantly shipping code, but less because I'm not writing any of it. It's really bizarre.\n\nI'm sure there are devs & architects out there building real, actual stuff and having AI write all of it? But I haven't seen many posts about this myself, so I thought it was prudent to put together a video and share it as \"proof of work(ing, complex app in production that makes real money)\"\n\nI thought this subreddit may find this interesting.

{"postId":"1nwtv4j","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Tested GPT-5 Codex vs Claude Sonnet 4.5 vs Kimi K2 on a real refactor task","selftext":"PS: Originally shared by a community member in the Codex Discord, reposting here for visibility. \n\nToday I ran a side-by-side experiment: I gave three different coding models the exact same task - refactor some tightly-coupled database ops into a single package, optimize INSERTs with time-based batching, and rewrite a handful of stored procedures into native Go. The repo is a big mono-repo with multiple build targets, so there was plenty of surface area.\n\n**Results:**\n\n* **GPT-5 Codex (medium)** Changed 23 files across the codebase. It was slowest, but it covered everything: updated [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md), refactored all build targets, adapted existing test files, and basically just got it right. Honestly felt like a senior dev who actually read the codebase.\n* **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)** Only touched 11 files. It half-assed the job by creating the new package but leaving old references all over the place. Didn‚Äôt bother with tests. The style felt like junior-level output, like a trainee poking around. It was the fastest, but very sloppy.\n* **Kimi K2 (Opencode Zen)** Made changes to 15 files. Missed one build target (so \\~25% incomplete) but the actual solution was clean and pragmatic. Reading the diff, it looked almost exactly how I would have written it myself. The catch: cost came out to **$4.11**, which is pricey for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGPT-5 Codex is still way ahead - slower, but the only one that really nailed the whole task. Claude Sonnet seems to have taken a step backwards with 4.5, optimizing for speed/token usage at the expense of quality. Kimi K2 is solid and pragmatic, probably the best open source option if you‚Äôre okay with the price.\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed the same: Codex being comprehensive, Claude regressing, Kimi feeling closest to human-like pragmatic output.

{"postId":"1nwgwp4","subreddit":"ClaudeCode","title":"Garbage in garbage out","selftext":"I‚Äôm a Claude Code user on Max x5, having started my journey a couple of months ago. I experienced quality degradation over the past few weeks but noticed recovery around two weeks ago. My theory is that resources were diverted to Sonnet 4.5 development and have since been restored.\n\nDuring that period, I managed by planning with Opus and executing with Sonnet, though results were mixed.\n\nMy brief trial of Codex was disappointing‚Äîlots of explanations with zero actionable results‚Äîso I decided to stick with Claude.\n\nNow with Sonnet 4.5, I‚Äôm extremely satisfied. I haven‚Äôt touched Opus since, have resolved numerous pending issues, and have only used 3% of my weekly limit.\n\nBased on many complaints I‚Äôve seen here, I believe there‚Äôs a fundamental misunderstanding about what‚Äôs currently achievable with these tools.\n\nCode-based LLMs are primarily trained on existing codebases‚Äîlikely open-source projects, though Anthropic may have access to some proprietary ones as well. With upcoming privacy changes, user prompts and code inputs will likely play an increasingly important role.\n\nThe average code quality across millions of open-source projects is, at best, ‚Äúaverage‚Äù‚Äîa few exceptional examples get diluted by much lower-quality code.\n\nI don‚Äôt view LLMs as magic converters that turn garbage into gold, but rather as tools that excel at routine tasks.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a top-tier developer who understands how a team of five normally-skilled developers would perform, you can achieve comparable or even better output at a fraction of the cost.\n\nHowever, this requires deep understanding‚Äîyou need to grasp what you‚Äôre building well enough to do most of it yourself. The difference is that you can now focus on being the software architect rather than the coder.\n\nWith Claude Code, I can now accomplish solo what would previously have required either ten times the hours or a team of, say, three junior and two senior developers. Anyone who‚Äôs managed such a team knows it requires substantial input to get things done right.\n\nSo as the title suggests: if your architectural input is poor, Claude Code won‚Äôt magically transform it. But if you plan well and possess strong oversight and deep understanding, you can accomplish things individually that were previously impossible.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã","score":12,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nwgwp4/garbage_in_garbage_out/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nwgwp4/garbage_in_garbage_out/","author":"franzel_ka","created":1759441168,"numComments":7,"comments":[{"id":"nhg84ru","parentId":null,"postId":"1nwgwp4","depth":0,"text":"I totally agree.

Co incidence ?  I think not.\n\n>With Claude Code, I can now accomplish solo what would previously have required either ten times the hours or a team of, say, three junior and two senior developers. Anyone who‚Äôs managed such a team knows it requires substantial input to get things done right.\n\nThis is so true. Well said.\n\nOne of the great things about Claude versus working with a human team is that a) his fixes are instantaneous and b) he had endless patience for making changes or trying things.\n\nWith a team there is usually a communication pipeline that issues much go through... create an incident/change report, etc.  Usually the developers are busy working on something, so they'll get to it when they'll get to it.  Then it takes a while to figure things out and make the change.  With a human team the test -> find -> document -> fix -> test loop is at least hours if not days.\n\nWith Claude this loop is minutes.  I use Claude as a pair programming partner, with him doing most of the coding and me transforming the story into prompts, gathering data to support the use case, generating the prompts, then quality checking the code that got generated, sometimes cleaning it up, testing it and issuing prompts for changes and bug fixes.  All this in Agile fashion, incrementally.  Always be shipping.   \n\nClaude and I can write, test and fix up code incredibly fast, because the loop is so tight and fast.   My head is still in the context of the issue and my tools are still set up when I get the fixed code back.  There is no documentation delay - things are handled immediately.  I know the use case of the features we are adding, I don't need to formally communicate them to a team.  And if I mess up, Claude is very quick to make code changes. \n\nI'm very happy with Claude.","score":3,"author":"yycTechGuy","created":1759446129},{"id":"nhg57ol","parentId":null,"postId":"1nwgwp4","depth":0,"text":"That's nice to hear, I've been really enjoying Sonnet 4.5, and most of the comments in this sub are complaints, esp. from Opus heavy users\n\nCould you share a little more regarding the process you follow, and what are the differences in your planning process using Opus vs Sonnet 4.5?

Having started developing almost 50 years ago, AI coding is just a tiny drop in an ocean of accumulated knowledge for me. This allows me to work much faster without a team and implement new things I haven't done before, but can grasp from a higher-level perspective.\n\nFor example, my current project uses a lot of PHP‚Äîa language I'd never encountered before. Now it's like learning a foreign language when you already speak three fluently and understand several more. I'm glad Claude can handle most of it, but naturally, I can immediately spot problematic or missing parts.\n\nAI will transform the future for all of us, and the challenge for developers will be the same as in school: still learning all the basics.

I use Claude Web sometimes, but mostly Gemini 2.5 Pro on AI Studio to plan stuff out, make markdown files, double-check them in other chats to make sure they're solid, then hand it all to Claude Code to actually write.\n\nI babysit Claude Code hard. Always watching what it's doing so I can jump in with more instructions or stop it immediately if needed. Never let it commit anything - I do all commits myself.\n\nI'm up at 5am and I send a quick \"hello\" to kick off my first session.

Any way to disable or load them on demand?","selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve noticed something strange while using Claude Code (but also similar with Copilot / Codex integrations). When I check the context usage, a big chunk of tokens is already consumed just by listing MCP tools (e.g. `mcp__sentry_*`, `mcp__chrome-devtools_*`, `mcp__context7_*`, etc.).\n\nThe weird part: I never actually invoked those tools, but their full definitions still get injected into the context. In my case this takes **tens of thousands of tokens right from the start**, leaving much less room for my actual code or conversation.\n\nSo I have a few questions for the community:\n\n* Is this *normal behavior* (i.e. unavoidable overhead when MCP tools are available)?\n* Is there any way to **disable MCP tools** I don‚Äôt need, or **enable them only on demand**?\n* Can the initial ‚Äútool discovery‚Äù be turned off, so the context doesn‚Äôt get filled until I explicitly ask to use that tool?\n\nRight now it feels like a huge waste of context space, especially for longer coding sessions.

Sonnet 4.5, like 4, needs three tries, a pep talk, and a scented candle to complete what Codex now does in one confident go. It starts strong, then halfway through forgets what it was doing like it left the stove on. It still gets stuck in 30 retry tarpits it just can't figure out.\n2. The VS Code extension was a long-awaited feature, but it's giving Clippy vibes. No matter what mode I set or how many bypass flags I threw at it in root CLI, it just kept asking for permission like it was trying to unlock my trust issues.\n\nA few months ago, Claude Code felt ahead of the curve.

The project's main purpose revolves around creating a machine learning model.\n\nI am not a genius coder nor do I have years of experience in programming. Therefore, I will rely heavily on Al models when it comes to implementation (I do not need heavy reasoning since I know what I need to do, I just need strong implementation with minimal errors). I prefer quality over quantity. I wouldn't want my tokens to run out every 15 minutes or wait weeks for them to refresh, but I wouldn't risk any quality issues over these factors.\n\nI also do not have a large budget. For instance, if I were to opt for Claude Code, I would go for the Pro plan. The same goes for Codex, I would opt for the Plus plan (both being 20$/month).\n\nI have been investigating these four models for the last few days. To my knowledge, Claude and Codex are the two that are more refined right now, compared to Gemini CLI and Cursor. However, I have seen mixed opinions about Claude and Codex. Both seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. They also seem to be quite similar.\n\nFor my final question, considering my situation, which model should I opt for?\n\nThanks to everyone that has read and will read my post.","score":1,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nu9qc9/question_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_gemini_cli_vs/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nu9qc9/question_claude_code_vs_codex_vs_gemini_cli_vs/","author":"GnomesInMyHome","created":1759228724,"numComments":0,"comments":[]}

By default, it opens as a split editor tab and can be moved to a new window, but it can‚Äôt be placed in the right sidebar.\n\nMost AI assistants (and built‚Äëin AI features in tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot) live in a sidebar. Extensions like Cline and Codex default to the primary sidebar and can be moved to the secondary sidebar, so they coexist nicely with Copilot or other assistants in the sidebars.\n\nPreviously, the Claude extension had a terminal‚Äëstyle UI. That version could live in the Panel by default, be moved to the editor area, and then be detached into a new window. The new editor‚Äëtab UI is great for full‚Äëwidth use, but it makes sidebar/panel placement impossible.\n\nFor many workflows, a tall, narrow sidebar is more space‚Äëefficient than an editor tab above the panel.

I didn't see mistakes like this at all before.\n\nthe context window degradation is obvious too. it used to maintain awareness of 4-5 related files across a conversation. now it forgets what we discussed more often. i'll reference \"the function we just modified\" and get back \"i dont see that function in the file\" even tho we literally just edited it together.\n\ni'm pretty sure whats happening is theyre either:\n\n1. using a distilled/quantized version of the model to save on inference costs\n2. reducing context window size dynamically based on load\n3. implementing some kind of quality-of-service throttling that they don't disclose\n\nthe pattern is too consistent to be random. \n\nand before someone replies with \"context engineering\" or \"skill issue\" - i've been writing software for 12 years. i know how to decompose problems, provide context, and iterate on solutions. the issue isn't prompt quality, its that the model capabilities have observably degraded over a 6 week period while costs have increased.\n\nthis is basically the playbook: attract users with unsustainable pricing/quality, then slowly degrade the experience once theyre locked in and restructure workflows around your tool. i've seen it happen with nearly every devtool that gets to scale.\n\nthe frustrating part is the dishonesty. just tell us you're running a cheaper model. let us opt into \"fast but expensive\" vs \"slow but cheap\" modes. don't gaslight users into thinking nothings changed when the difference is obvious to anyone who has used it consistently.\n\nanyway i'm probably switching back to claude code or trying out factory, when i've tested these recently they both did seem better. \n\nanyone tracked performance degradation quantitatively or is this just anecdotal?

I tried the Codex CLI on the $20 plan for the first time last night. It is.. similar.. but different. I can accept that. But I am wondering if there are any suggestions, tips, etc on how to make it a bit more seamless? As well, I set up commands (/ commands) using .md files in Claude using that AgentOS thing and SuperClaude as well. Is there similar for Codex?\n\nNow I am only on the $20 plan, and in an hour used about 10% of my weekly use.. as I am working on the very core/guts (e.g. most important parts) of my \"startup\" idea.. I am choosing to use the highest model, similar to how I was mostly using OPUS for the deeper analyzing/thinking/planning which no doubt many here know who came from that used to be great but now you go through your weekly opus in 3 to 4 hours of use.. so its basically useless now. \n\nI am unsure at this time how good Codex at highest model mode is to Opus or Sonnet 4.5. I am seeing a variety of mixed \"its better\" to \"its no where near close\". I have to imagine that those responses are all over the map with regards to what the tool is being used to help with. I am working with Zig, Wasm, Go, Rust, and C code. So I am hoping that Codex is pretty rock solid with those languages. That is one thing I was impressed with that Claude did quite well. Being that Codex is an \"improved\" ChatGPT for languages, I am hoping it will work well enough especially with Zig which is as some may now a VERY early language (though crazy how high end production tools are already created with it). \n\nThank you.

I built this","selftext":"I started using Cursor almost a year ago, then in July I used Claude Code, and in August I started with Codex. IDEs like VS Code/Cursor were designed as code editors. Then AI became a helper‚Ä¶ but now we've reached a point where AI is the main driver and we only edit bits of code here and there. That's a new paradigm and not how IDEs were originally designed.¬†\n\nI agree IDEs are more user-friendly, but the flexibility of the terminal gives you real freedom. I tried tmux and it's great for managing multiple terminals, but it's not specifically designed for coding, so I missed many VS Code/Cursor features.\n\nSo I thought: what if I build an app that takes the best of both worlds: UI and capabilities of an IDE, but designed for AI-driven coding?\n\nI've been using it for a week and it's seriously improved my productivity ([see my GitHub profile](https://github.com/miguelpieras)). You can guess when I started using it.¬†\n\n\n\n**Features:**\n\n\\- It works with the IDE or your choice (codex, claude code, cursor...). You can even combine them.\n\n\\- Project tabs: group terminals into projects for easy access and monitoring.\n\n\\- Per-project instances: multiple Codex/Claude sessions, multiple standard terminals (for scripts like npm run dev), and built-in web browser previews‚Äîso you don't have to keep switching between VS Code/Cursor, terminals, and browser tabs.\n\n\\- Auto-restore: project tabs + layouts are restored on next launch.\n\n\\- Notifications: get alerted when a terminal finishes.\n\n\\- One-click GitHub actions: deploy or open a PR.\n\n\\- Diff view: see code changes quickly.\n\n\\- Quick actions: copy path, open project in VS Code/Cursor, open in Finder, etc.\n\n\\- One-click screenshots: capture + copy from the embedded web browser to paste straight into the terminal.\n\n\\- Mobile app to keep coding while on the move (pending App Store approval).\n\n\n\nIt's worked so well that whenever I had to close it during development and go back to plain terminals or Cursor, I missed it instantly.\n\nI called it CODIGO.

Also, the context percentage shows continually so you can choose when you want to wrap up your work and compact or reset on your terms instead of being surprised \n\nBecause token burn increases the longer the context. So you can do short little jobs and keep resetting. If you're getting a lot of good work done, you can keep going your choice \n\nIt has an extension. Isn't as granular as the CLI but you can make a plan and get a lot of things done first. Just know that it uses more token burn because it does more stuff whether you want it to or not \n\n\nThe third item is codex web and depending on how many jobs and what you're doing in the codex extension, you can send those jobs to the codex web and get them back later. You can't change the model. It keeps the 03 model but it's not bad for low end work like linting or refactoring small things so you don't have to burn all your context doing every single little thing \n\nIf you're using the CLI full-time on one project as in a full day of not stopping from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. you can get about 2 days or 2 and 1/2 days before you get the reset warning for the week and that is 5 days. \n\nThat's on the plus account. Depending on how much you use, you might want a second account. The business account (renamed from teams) is 30 per account and does not give you additional token use. It only gives you shared workspace. \n\nSo depending on how much you use it, three accounts for 60 make more sense. When one of your accounts taps out all you do is type codex logout and then log back in with your other account. \n\nThat does mean the CLI has to close. So when you feel like you're getting close you should start saving more often. When I get surprised, I will copy the last page out into a separate window called context. Then when I reload a fresh window, I will just give the path to it and say check the existing body of work against the last context here and start and that usually works","score":19,"author":"FarVision5","created":1758596663},{"id":"nfqj67v","parentId":"nfpilah","postId":"1no3xr9","depth":1,"text":"They are all using GTP5, and codex web is using GPT-5-codex now.

It sounds like you're running into some pretty common limitations with Codex when it comes to executing commands and accessing the file system. Here are a few thoughts that might help you troubleshoot and potentially work around these issues.\n\n1. **MCPs and Shell Access**: Codex is indeed a bit more restrictive compared to Claude when it comes to executing shell commands and interacting with the file system. It‚Äôs designed with a focus on safety and security, which can limit its ability to run inline commands or access the file system directly. If you want to enable more flexibility, consider using a wrapper around Codex that can handle these interactions separately. This way, you can send commands to the wrapper, which then executes them in a controlled environment.\n\n2. **Permissions and Configuration**: Double-check your environment setup. Make sure that the API keys and permissions are correctly configured to allow Codex to access the resources it needs. Sometimes, the issue can be as simple as a missing permission or an incorrect API endpoint.\n\n3. **Sandboxing Solutions**: If you're looking for a more robust solution, you might want to explore using a platform like Cognitora.dev. They leverage Firecracker microVMs for sub-second startup times and provide hardware-level isolation for agent sandboxes. This could allow you to run Codex in a more flexible environment where you can manage file access and execute shell commands without the typical restrictions.\n\n4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: If you're planning to scale this out or coordinate multiple agents, Cognitora also supports A2A protocols, which can help you manage interactions between different agents more effectively. This could be particularly useful if you want to have Codex work alongside other models or agents.\n\n5. **Persistent File Systems**: With Cognitora, you can also take advantage of persistent file systems, which would allow Codex to read and write files as needed, overcoming the limitations you're currently facing.\n\nIn summary, while Codex has its limitations, there are ways to work around them by adjusting your setup or leveraging platforms that provide more flexibility.

But I may end up using multiple accounts.\n\nThe biggest thing for me is that codex seems to \"measure twice, cut once\" - it actually takes the effort to understand the data flows in my code without me having to supply so much context. Works better than my claude-context MCP and md files. I can definitely get claude to work, but yeah...codex just gets shit done (I use gpt medium).\n\n  \nEDIT: Looking back at this comment - just wanted to make its clear that I was more talking about the codex agent, not the codex models. I have to experiment with those more. So my comment isn't 100% relevant.","score":18,"author":"Organic_Cranberry_22","created":1758004139},{"id":"nejlcps","parentId":"nehcwj0","postId":"1ni9qiu","depth":1,"text":"Just request a refund, did the same","score":3,"author":"KAMIKAZEE93","created":1758037967},{"id":"nehhala","parentId":"nehcwj0","postId":"1ni9qiu","depth":1,"text":"use cloud codex it s open bar and awesome. renewed 200usd claude plan yesterday too","score":2,"author":"bacocololo","created":1758006697},{"id":"nehmaqy","parentId":"nehhala","postId":"1ni9qiu","depth":2,"text":"Cc sub renew today, should check if it‚Äôs already gone through or not, might cancel seeing this","score":1,"author":"Sbrusse","created":1758009786},{"id":"neka6zf","parentId":"nehmaqy","postId":"1ni9qiu","depth":3,"text":"Other comments mentioned talking to the claude support bot and requesting a refund.

However I wanted it in 3d space with neural nets for each creature and ai overseer and a learning setup with nice graphics, internal creature language and sensory development etc. it took Claude couple days with minimal input about 8k code lines with my input limited to telling it what I didn‚Äôt like and where it needed to go. After that I  had it make a complex script making Linux work smoothly for a novice user as I wasn‚Äôt about to read a Linux Bible and memorize it. Took it 5 hrs. Claude also coded me a proof of concept where data and execution was purely driven by messages and it worked perfect out of the box. I pushed it even farther after that and made another proof of concept where data and execution was encoded as a nodal interference pattern and after some back and forth clarification it done that. Made human language response using primitives encoded into 500k response database that was calculated on the fly in 0.5 seconds ( think about it as a poor man‚Äôs LLM) to jumpstart a parser directing queries to APIs. It done that flawlessly and it guesstimated it to be an equivalent of a 2B LLM in performance. Subsequently it made me a ‚Äúseed‚Äù LLM growing and developing itself slowly. It made it work. After all that it started making a Lisp like language and interpreter without the top down flow using lessons learned from earlier projects.  I was half way through a GUI when Claude got stupid.

I've tried gpt-5 and gpt-5-codex medium and it did a couple of things out of place, even though I stayed on one topic AND was using less than 50% tokens. It duplicated elements on the page (instead of updating them) or deleted entire files instead of editing them, changed certain styles and functionality when I did not ask it to, wiped out data I had stored locally for testing (again I didn't ask it to), and simply took too much time, and also needed me to approve for the session seemingly an endless number of times.\n\nWhile I am not new to using tools (I've used CC and GitHub copilot previously), I recognise CC and Codex are different and will have their own strengths and weaknesses. Claude was impressive (until the recent frustrating limits) and it could tackle significant tasks on its own, and it had days when it would just forget too many things or introduce too many bugs, and other better days.\n\nI am not trying to criticise anyone setup/anything, but I want to learn.

And include any relevant  requirment that you have. \n\n\nI mostly use GPT5 high or medium.  GPT-5 Codex didn‚Äôt work well for me, it is good for people with more technical knowledge.

{"postId":"1o4jr3n","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"What ACTUALLY works after testing every AI coding tool for 6 months","selftext":"I've been using AI to code every single day for the past 6 months. Tried everything: Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, RooCode, Coderabbit, Traycer, Continue, ChatPRD, Cline. Some worked great. Most didn't.\n\nAfter burning through hundreds of hours and way too much money on subscriptions, here's what I learned.\n\n# Important stuff\n\n**Tell AI exactly what you want**   \n  \nStop hoping it'll figure things out. Write 1-2 clear sentences about what needs to happen before giving any task. \"Fix the auth bug\" is garbage. \"Fix the JWT refresh token not updating in /src/auth/token.ts line 45\" will actually work.\n\n**Plan before you code**   \n  \nThis changed everything for me. Break everything into specific file-level steps BEFORE writing any code. Most tools give you vague plans like \"update authentication service.\" That's useless. You need \"modify refreshToken() function in /src/auth/token.ts lines 40-60.\" Use tools like Traycer, ChatPRD or even just ChatGPT/Claude to plan out things properly before you start coding.\n\n**Feed small chunks, not whole repos**  \n  \nI noticed everyone dumps their entire codebase into AI. That's why their code breaks. Point to specific files and line numbers. The models lose focus with too much context, even with huge context windows.\n\n**Review everything twice**   \n  \nFirst with your own eyes. Then let an AI reviewer (like Coderabbit) catch what you missed. Sounds paranoid but it's saved me from pushing broken code more times than I can count. Remember to TREAT AI LIKE A JUNIOR DEV. \n\n# The mistakes everyone makes\n\n* Vague prompts give you vague code. \"Make it better\" gives you nothing useful.\n* \"Update the button color\" sounds simple but which button? where? Be specific or watch AI update random stuff across your app.\n* Letting AI pick your tech stack means it'll import random packages from its training data. Tell it EXACTLY what to use.\n* \"It runs\" doesn't mean it works. I learned this the hard way multiple times.\n\n# My actual workflow\n\n**Planning** \n\nI tried Windsurf's planning mode, Claude Code's planning, Traycer's planner. Only Traycer gives actual file-level detail with parallel execution paths. The others just list high-level steps you already know.\n\nFor complex planning, the expensive models work best but for most daily work, the standard models are fine when you structure the prompts right.\n\n**Coding** \n\nCursor was great until their pricing went crazy. Claude Code is my go-to now, especially after proper planning. Windsurf and Cline work too but honestly, once you have a solid plan, they all perform similarly. I'm hearing a lot of great things about Codex too but haven't tried it out yet.\n\nThe newest Gemini models are decent for simple stuff but can't compete with Anthropic's latest models for complex code.\n\n**Review** \n\nThis is where most people mess up. You NEED code review. CodeRabbit catches issues I miss, suggests optimizations, and actually understands context across files. Works great on PRs if your team's cool with it, or just use their IDE extension if not.\n\nTraycer's file-level review is good for checking specific changes. Cursor's review features exist but aren't worth the price increase.\n\nTLDR;\n\n* Be super specific with AI prompts by naming exact files, functions, and line numbers instead of vague requests\n* Plan everything in detail first before writing any code\n* Feed AI small chunks of specific files rather than dumping your entire codebase\n* Always double-check your code yourself then use AI reviewers to catch missed issues\n\n","score":287,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4jr3n/what_actually_works_after_testing_every_ai_coding/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4jr3n/what_actually_works_after_testing_every_ai_coding/","author":"notdl","created":1760257714,"numComments":97,"comments":[{"id":"nj30rck","parentId":null,"postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":0,"text":"Summary:\nAfter testing every major AI coding tool for 6 months, the key takeaways are:\n\nBe extremely specific with prompts (mention exact files, functions, and lines).\n\nAlways plan detailed file-level steps before coding.\n\nGive AI small, focused chunks - not your whole repo.\n\nReview code twice: yourself first, then with an AI reviewer.\nBest combo: Traycer for planning, Claude Code for coding, and CodeRabbit for reviews.","score":85,"author":"codestormer","created":1760266161},{"id":"nj3j3xy","parentId":"nj30rck","postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":1,"text":"Summary Summary:\nBe ultra-specific in prompts, plan steps at the file level, feed AI small chunks, and double-review the code (you first, then AI).

People who don't want to do any configuration and just want something that just works - that's Codex right now. \n\nClaude code needs customization. Very powerful but the default philosophy of the tool is bare bones. Part of that is a strategy. It didn't need very much tooling and did very well on benchmarks, but one of the things about those benchmarks is it wasn't very efficient while doing it. It's no surprise to me that Anthropic was one of the earliest proponents of the model context protocol, because Claude code needs to be extended by tools and hooks. \n\nHowever, recently, after lagging behind the front-runners for a long time, GitHub Copilot is making a solid comeback. An absolute underrated dark horse is Grok Coder Fast in github Copilot. \n\nI think part of why it perhaps has flown under the radar is that it's not as big-picture as either Sonnet or ChatGPT-5. You absolutely need to either be actively involved in making the initial plan (which is hardly the point of agentic coding). But if you have the very first turn where you make a plan be one of the more capable models, Grok Coder Fast absolutely crushes the execution. \n\n\nI used to like to say that Claude's strength wasn't in being the best coder, but the best worker. Sonnet had a lot of early success because it was very persistent. The peak of what I meant was around the Sonnet 3.5 era, where comparing it to the other models of the time (like the GPT variants) which would give up at the drop of a hat, Claude would soldier on. I think that's still true to an extent, but the latest iteration of ChatGPT-5 has made that advantage less valuable, and I find that Claude's over-eagerness, while toned down in 4.5, isn't enough of an advantage anymore. \n\n\nGrok Coder Fast though knows how to code, and as a persistent worker, it just needs to be paired with a dedicated reasoner to keep it pointed in the right direction and remind it to consider the bigger picture. \n\nThe most satisfying coding tool for me at this point is Kilo Code with specialized agent roles. I feel like the specialized agent thing is often undersold because half of the time when people mean a specialized agent, they just mean the same exact model but with a different set of prompts. People are often too lazy to even customize the tooling available to each sub-agent, so it's really just the same model with a different coat of paint on it. \n\n\nI'd implore everybody, especially anyone who hasn't tried a multi-agent system that actually works, to pick up Kilo Code and understand how vital the separation of roles with clean context passing between them and automatic delegation between them. That's the other piece that's missing. Nobody wants to be clicking and selecting different modes on their agents all the time. \n\nWhat I do is I expressly prompt the Kilo code orchestrator to have their architect make a plan to execute the whatever task I've assigned it. More importantly than that, I order the orchestrator to only delegate 3-4 steps of a task to the coding agent for execution at a time, and then have it pass back to the orchestrator to pass to a reviewing agent to check the others' work immediately. \n\nThis sort of atomic delegation is exactly the workflow that you have to do in cloud code with the plan execute loop. But the agent handles it that itself automatically. And not only that, unlike in plan mode, it clears and gives a clean set of instructions to the new agent. And not only that, a clean set of instructions for each subtask and a clean set of instructions for each reviewer. \n\n\nThe magic that emerges from that is that you can and should use much faster agents on the execution and review portion because they can move quickly. Most of the time, those agents write excellent code, and where they haven't written excellent code, I sure hope that you put in your prompt that the architect should have written snippets that cover all of the important pain points during writing the entire plan. \n\nAnd that's what you get at the end: you get code designed by the smartest model executed by a fast model, so you can do quick iteration that comes pre-reviewed, so you don't have to copy and paste and switch between your tools. It's all executed in a nice bow, and you don't get things like Sonnet's tendency in Claude Code to write some ridiculous summary about what it did because the agent in charge is the orchestrator who you can prompt independently to be pretty sedate.\n\nI'm a firm believer that the only reason we haven't seen this workflow become more prevalent and dominant is that it's a nightmare to quantitatively get quality metrics and improve on it. Instead of having to optimize just one set of prompts and tooling for a consistent experience for your customers, now you've got to optimize a whole team. And you can see as with the Claude experience, most people do not care enough to customize their tools and will not get enough mileage out of this. \n\nWe'll see large-scale adoption of this workflow at some point when the models are tuned enough to dynamically rewrite the prompts of the entire team, and that's become just a common place practice. P.S. This is just how GPT Pro and Grok Heavy work anyway.","score":5,"author":"Coldaine","created":1760285069},{"id":"nj5jct5","parentId":"nj4dpp4","postId":"1o4jr3n","depth":4,"text":"I've tried the orchestrator route a few times, and it generally devolves to noise pretty quickly. Even the smartest models devolve to noise if you give them a long enough leash and a complex enough problem, and relying on a model to plan for you and then hand problems over to a less competent model just does not seem that effective to me.\n\nLike I fired up codex for the first time in a while, just trying to get something done but had a rough night so too tired to do it myself, writing some tests and modifying one class to make it more testable, copy/pasting the new code into the chatGPT project I'm using to talk through the project which has all the context and having it do code review, then going until all the tests look reasonable and all are passing, then I make a PR and do my own code review.\n\nI had a layout class that it could use to understand the expected schema; instead of adding a field to the layout, it made a local layout copy nested inside of the class it was working on. but it wasn't even supposed to use the layout class; it was supposed to just update a different field. So it used the wrong class, but on top of that, it copied it and now there are 2 different layouts which have different structures.\n\nEven still, you can write programs that mostly work, and just keep churning tokens for new features and only drop in when it gets really stuck which is getting rarer and rarer today.

{"postId":"1o4ir16","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Vibe Coding and the Popularization of CLI Interfaces: Why Don‚Äôt Big Companies Use Millions of Users as Contributors to Improve Models?","selftext":"I‚Äôd like to share some thoughts and ask a question.\n\nRecently, tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and other AI-based code generation CLI interfaces have become very popular -  their audience is around 15 million users worldwide. Together, these services generate over two trillion tokens per month.\n\nHowever, one thing puzzles me. We all know that even the most advanced AI models are imperfect and often cannot unambiguously and correctly execute even simple coding instructions. So why don‚Äôt big companies : OpenAI, Anthropic, and others -use this huge pool of users as live contributors and testers? Logically, this could significantly improve the quality of the models.\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm missing something, but I reason like this: the user sends a request, and if the result satisfies them, they move on to the next one. If the model makes a mistake, the user provides feedback, and based on that, improvements and further training of the model are initiated. This continuous cycle could become an excellent real-time data collection system for training models.\n\nYou could even introduce some incentive system, like subscription discounts for those who agree to participate in such feedback. Those who don‚Äôt want to participate would pay a bit more for a ‚Äúsilent‚Äù subscription without feedback.\n\nIt seems like a fairly simple and effective way to massively improve AI tools, but from my perspective, it‚Äôs strange that such an idea hasn‚Äôt been clearly implemented yet. Maybe someone has thoughts on why that is?","score":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4ir16/vibe_coding_and_the_popularization_of_cli/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1o4ir16/vibe_coding_and_the_popularization_of_cli/","author":"Crafty_Gap1984","created":1760253854,"numComments":17,"comments":[{"id":"nj2jh00","parentId":null,"postId":"1o4ir16","depth":0,"text":"Do we tell him?","score":6,"author":"Leather-Cod2129","created":1760255344},{"id":"nj2jofb","parentId":"nj2jh00","postId":"1o4ir16","depth":1,"text":"Tell him what? /s","score":2,"author":"ThreeKiloZero","created":1760255470},{"id":"nj33dyg","parentId":"nj2jofb","postId":"1o4ir16","depth":2,"text":"The secret","score":2,"author":"pardeike","created":1760267637},{"id":"nj38vpm","parentId":"nj33dyg","postId":"1o4ir16","depth":3,"text":"Unless you are from those companies and want to make a disclosure about the code use (which is against their published official rules) - great!

I love vibing code nowadays, thought I'd share my current top 5 tools.\n\n1. Cursor. This is still the king of AI code editors IMO. I've used it since they first released it. Definitely had some rough edges back then but these days it just keeps getting better. I like to use GPT Codex for generating plan documents and then I use Cheetah or another fast model for writing the code.\n2. [Zed](https://zed.dev/). I use Zed as my terminal because the Cursor/VSCode terminal sucks. I sometimes run Claude Code inside Zed, they have a nice UX on top of Claude Code. I also use Zed whenever I want to edit code by hand because it's a way smoother experience.\n3. [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop). When you generate a ton of code with AI, it's important to keep good hygiene with version control and have a nice UI for reviewing code changes. Github Desktop is my first line of defense when it comes to review.\n4. [Claude Code Github Action](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions). I prefer this to tools like CodeRabbit because it just a Github Workflow and it's easy to customize the way Claude Code runs to generate the review.\n5. [Zo Computer](https://www.zo.computer/). This is my go-to tool for doing AI coding side projects, personal automations, and I also use it to research and generate plans for features in my larger projects.

It's an underrated tool that ties back in heavily to the thing about the context getting polluted with an inaccurate assumption or conclusion that permanently compromises the conversation from that point forward.

Also - there can be qwenCLI added on top of that (but not really necessary even with GLM lite plan being cheapest one) if more sustainability is needed - but I didn't felt that as much needed recently as a few weeks ago. This post's idea (main one) is to share my thoughts after a few hundred thousand vibecoded code lines + a few real, commercial projects delivered already across my local environment. Nobody knows those projects (except their current owners) are 98-100% vibecoded :) so this stack is reliable more or less. Especially compared to claude max20, GPT PRO plans etc. high-cost options.\n\nA bit of background - I'm a regular 9-5 employee as Head of Quality Assurance, process and engineering (in short words), 10+ years of experience across software dev industry. Been coding using AI since first GPT beta really, heavy AI API user in the past and currently aswell via. my corporate job. Freelancer - vibecoder after hours with successful side hustle based on developing simple software / websites for local businesses for past few months.\n\nI established my go-to setup for vibecoding as:\n\n[zed.dev](http://zed.dev)¬†\\- the IDE being AI native, allowing us to connect any LLM via. api directly. Agent being especially useful for longer tasks, allowing us to easily track what AI is working on right now, pretty nice summaries of what was done etc. Also being lightweight over VSC makes it a big win - but what i found the most interesting that AI agent built in ZED doesn't waste my tokens. Keeps context clean by not adding stuff idiotically on top like all plugins out there do - so you can efficiently use up to 85% of max tokens per LLM - and then agent will prompt you to comapct the conversation and start from summary which is also done in a bit different way than CC and other things do - but in a better way preserving context.  \n[GLM coding plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?cc=fission_glmcode_sub_v1&ic=CUEFJ9ALMX&n=em***k%40gmail.com) \\- being the cheaperst opensource SOTA model, capable of delivering stuff and doing things on the sonnet4 pre-anthropic-problems level. Recently had a few cases where i just left GLM with the bug and let it worked on it's own for like 10 or 15 minutes - it's been quite long, but at the end it resolved the complicated issue without my interference. But what's the most important thing is the coding plan being priced especially good - 3$ per month, with ability to secure the price for full year for 36$ (cheaper with my link) - for 120 prompts per 5h it's a nobrainer deal to have capable model. Maybe not the fastest in the world, but as a solopreneur / freelancer it's a huge win for me. Personally I am on Max plan right now - which basically grants no limits as you'll not be able to spin up enough agents to get through 2400 promtps per 5h. It paid for itself during past weekend as i finished developing some tiny bits of software for my client. Efficiency vs cost ratio here is totally awesome - especially if you're trying to set your own business up or just increase profitability. Me switching from CC max20 plan (over 200euro in my country roughly with all the taxes) to GLM coding plan - even on max - saves me like 70% of my AI tools costs right now. So - more money for me to spend on idiotic stuff :D\n\n[openspec CLI¬†](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)\\- newly released specification driven framework to develop things. Previously i used¬†[traycer.ai](http://traycer.ai)¬†but recently successfully replaced it with openspec CLI. OFC traycer is more powerful - as it has autoreview etc. - but openspec being totally free and easily injected into existing codebase (which can't be really done as for now with Github Speckit sadly) to develop new features is another nobrainer. Early days, i believe it'll get even better, but ability to connect it to any LLM via. zed is awesome - and the output is solid aswell + it's not overcomplex as GH speckit.\n\nClaude Code Cli client - best CLI client to use with GLM coding plan or any other anthropic-compatible endpoint. I prefer¬†[zed.dev](http://zed.dev)¬†bc i like to see what my agent does in detail, but if you're looking for CLI agent - CC is the best still - with any LLM. Crush, opencode and others are there, but they're not capable of doing stuff as CC client does.\n\nGH speckit - perfect for starting a new project, but tricky to be injected into existing, non-speckit started codebase. Doesn't really work with complex codebase - but it's still my goto tool, especially after recent updates to just kick off new projects. Just wrap up proper prompts to start it and it'll wrap everything in a perfect way for pure vibecode development.\n\n","score":20,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nnoh8l/cheap_my_go_to_vibecoding_stack/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nnoh8l/cheap_my_go_to_vibecoding_stack/","author":"Bob5k","created":1758552417,"numComments":20,"comments":[{"id":"nfoys30","parentId":null,"postId":"1nnoh8l","depth":0,"text":"as someone who doesn't know from good code to bad code, how useful is this to someone like me","score":3,"author":"NairbHna","created":1758588577},{"id":"nfpxlwy","parentId":"nfoys30","postId":"1nnoh8l","depth":1,"text":"For the code itself Codex/Claude Code are probably more suitable as a more autonomous agentic tools.\n\nSpeckit may be useful as a more precise alternative to a plan mode - if you are willing to spend time and develop granular requirements.

Here's what I tried and my honest review:\n\n1. [Rork.com](http://rork.com/)¬†\\- I was sceptical, but it became a revelation for me. The best AI no-code app builder for native mobile apps in 2025. Way faster than I expected. All the technical stuff like APIs worked without me having to fix anything. Getting ready for app store submission. The previews loads fast and doesn't break unlike other tools that I tried. The code belongs to you -that's rare these days lol (read below). I think¬†[Rork](http://rork.com/)¬†is also best app builder for beginers or non-tech people\n2. [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)¬†\\- my biggest love. Thanks God it exists. It's a bit harder to get started than with Rork or Replit, but it's totally doable -¬†[this tutorial¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYiuzAsWnHU&t=723s)really helped me get into it (I started from scratch with zero experience, but now my app brings 7k mrr)**.**¬†Use Claude Code after Rork for advanced tweaking. The workflow is: prototype in Rork ‚Üí sync to GitHub ‚Üí iterate in Claude Code ‚Üí import them back to Rork to publish in App Store. Works well together. I'm also experimenting with¬†**parallel coding agents**¬†\\- it's hard to manage but sometimes the outcome is really good. Got inspired by¬†[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lja8k5/the_future_is_now_6_agents_in_parallel/)\n3. [Lovable.ai](http://lovable.ai/)¬†\\- pretty hyped, I mostly used it for website prototyping before, but after¬†[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)¬†I use it less and less. They have good UX, but honestly I can recognize Lovable website designs FROM A MILE AWAY (actually it is all kinda Claude designs right??) and I want something new.¬†**BTW I learn how to fix that, I'll drop a little lifehack at the end**. Plus Lovable can't make mobile apps.\n4. [Replit.com](http://replit.com/)¬†\\-I used Replit for a very long time, but when it came time to scale my product I realised I can't extract the code from Replit. Migration is very painful. So even for prototyping I lost interest - what's the point if I can't get my code out later? So this is why I stopped using Replit: 1) The AI keeps getting dumber with each update. It says it fixed bugs but didn't actually do anything. Having to ask the same thing multiple times is just annoying. 2) It uses fake data for everything instead of real functionality, which drags out projects and burns through credits. I've wasted so much money and time. 3) The pricing is insane now. Paying multiple times more for the same task? I'm done with that nonsense. For apps I realized that prototyping with Rork is much faster and the code belongs to me\n5. [FlutterFlow.com](http://flutterflow.com/)¬†\\- You have to do everything manually, which defeats the point for me. I'd rather let AI make the design choices since it usually does a better job anyway. If you're the type who needs to micromanage every button and color, you'll probably love it for mobile apps\n\nHonestly,¬†**traditional no-code solutions feel outdated to me now that we have AI vibecoding with prompts**. Why mess around with dragging components and blocks when you can just describe what you want? Feels like old tech at this point\n\n**IF YOU TIRED OF IDENTICAL VIBECODED DESIGN TOO this it how I fixed that:**¬†now I ask chat gpt to generate design prompt on my preferences, then I send exactly this prompt to gpt back and ask to generate UX/UI. Then I send generated images to Claude Code ask to use this design in my website. Done.

I have to hand hold it the entire way. Does it still speed me up by 2x? Sometimes even 10x? Sure!

I told it what happened and it apologised, then we went back and forth for about 10 minutes. The login button didn't appear. I told it to undo the work and I would do it manually.

{"postId":"1nbj2ep","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"$20 Codex/CC plan is better for devs than $200. Change My Mind","selftext":"Saying this as a person who had both $200 plan of Claude Code for months and $200 plan of ChatGPT Pro as soon as Codex was available, I found the $20 plan to be the best for individual developers.\n\n**Why not the $200 plan:** Model has way too much capability. It can do a lot. More than what you can monitor, manage, and carefully prompt. At that point, you go full on \"create a full fledge gazillion dollar app that does everything.\" With a prompt like that and s#$t ton of credits, the model starts with something useful until context rots and it hallucinates. It starts writing stuff you never asked for. Overcorrecting, overanalyzing, overdoing. Writing code, making errors, correcting itself, and the constant loop. This is especially terrible in recent versions of \"You're absolutely right!\" Claude Code.\n\n**Why not the free plan:** You'd then think whatever free plan for Codex/CC/Cursor/etc would suffice? Maybe. Free plan is too limiting. Ask it to do a repetitive task and halfway through something fairly decent you're hitting the usage limit.\n\n**Why $20 plan is the sweet spot:** The $20 plan serves you well. It is enough that you can ask it to create a nice UI on a webpage, create endpoints for your code, ask it to analyze performance issues, or overall code structure. It is just enough that you actually put in the effort to see the code and collaborate with the AI to write something good. It is just enough that you actually architect and write code yourself alongside. It is just enough that you do minor tasks yourself.

We call those users!\", but I decided to share anyway, as I can't find a GitHub repo and this might be useful to someone out there. The ChatGPT / Codex service also costs a non-trivial amount for most people on non-business plans, so issues like the ones described below can be quite discouraging.\n\n1. It is impossible to log into the extension when running VSCode in docker without manipulating the container (no option for deferred login or anything, just browser callbacks). Same for the CLI. We need an option to use a offline token or something like Claude Code has... Now you have to manually curl the response URL back on the VM or docker container, which does not even work properly for the CLI (there is no confirmation message, you have to re-open the app and the it \"works\")...\n2. Chat history is not preserved at all, refreshing or even moving the chat panel also deletes the current Task / conversation.\n3. The chat and entire VSCode app starts lagging unbearably after about 100 messages. The STOP button becomes unresponsive and the text is rendered at 0.5 TPS... The agent is basically stuck until you reboot the entire VSCode container. Also 100% browser CPU usage!\n4. There is no option to compact or reduce the conversation in the extension... And it does not seem to happen automatically, unless I've missed something.\n5. The built-in update\\_plan tool is borderline useless.... The model overwrites the entire task list with each update, making any plan longer than 10 steps basically unviable. I am honestly disappointed in the lack of effort here. The tool feels like it was vibe coded in 15 minutes by an intern with 0 experience in even basic day-to-day planning activities...\n\nMy personal opinion is that VM support should be a priority, as it's not safe to run any of these tools over bare metal, even with sandboxing and various guardrails.\n\nHas anyone else been dealing with similar problems or is there something wrong with my television set?","score":10,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n3yrbx/first_impressions_of_the_overhauled_codex_ide/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n3yrbx/first_impressions_of_the_overhauled_codex_ide/","author":"Ragecommie","created":1756551635,"numComments":3,"comments":[{"id":"nbh241a","parentId":null,"postId":"1n3yrbx","depth":0,"text":"You can use an offline token for the CLI - look at the directions for headless use (which basically IS vm support).

{"postId":"1n3y2vq","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Setting up MCP in Codex is easy, don‚Äôt let the TOML trip you up","selftext":"Now that Codex CLI & the IDE extension are out and picking up in popularity, let‚Äôs set them up with our favorite MCP servers.\n\nThe thing is, it expects¬†**TOML config**¬†as opposed to the standard¬†**JSON**¬†that we‚Äôve gotten used to, and it might seem confusing.\n\nNo worries ‚Äî it‚Äôs very similar. I‚Äôll show you how to quickly convert it, and share some nuances on the Codex implementation.\n\nIn this example, we‚Äôre just going to add this to your global¬†`~/.codex/config.toml`¬†file, and the good news is that both the IDE extension and CLI read from the same config.\n\nOverall, Codex works very well with MCP servers, the main limitation is that it currently only supports¬†**STDIO MCP servers**. No remote MCP servers (SSE or Streamable HTTP) are supported yet.  \nIn the docs, they do mention using MCP proxy for SSE MCP servers, but that still leaves out¬†**Streamable HTTP servers**, which is the ideal remote implementation IMO.  \nThat being said, they‚Äôre shipping a lot right now that I assume it‚Äôs coming really soon.\n\nBTW I also [recorded a short walkthrough](https://youtu.be/p5_PmnYc5Us) going over this, if you prefer watching over reading.\n\n# Getting started\n\nFirst things first: if you haven‚Äôt downloaded Codex CLI or the Codex extension, you should start with that.  \nHere‚Äôs the NPM command for the CLI:\n\n    npm install -g /codex\n\nYou should be able to find the extension in the respective IDE marketplace, if not you can follow the links from OpenAI‚Äôs developer pages here:¬†[https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide)\n\nGetting into your¬†`config.toml`¬†file is pretty easy:\n\n* In the extension, you can right-click the gear icon and it‚Äôll take you straight to the TOML file.\n* Or you can do it via terminal (first create¬†`.codex`¬†in your root and then the¬†`config.toml`).\n\nEither way, it‚Äôs simple.\n\n# TOML conversion\n\nIt‚Äôs really easy, it all comes down to rearranging the name, command, arguments, and env variable. IMO TOML looks better than JSON, but yeah it‚Äôs annoying that there isn‚Äôt a unified approach.  \nHere‚Äôs the example blank format OpenAI shows in the docs:\n\n    [mcp_servers.server-name]\n    command = \"npx\"\n    args = [\"-y\", \"mcp-server\"]\n    env = { \"API_KEY\" = \"value\" }\n\nSo let‚Äôs make this practical and look at the first MCP I add to all agentic coding tools:¬†**Context7**.\n\nHere‚Äôs the standard JSON format we‚Äôre used to:\n\n    \"Context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@upstash/context7-mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n\nSo it just comes down to a bit of rearranging. Final result in TOML:\n\n    [mcp_servers.Context7]\n    command = \"npx\"\n    args = [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp@latest\"]\n\nAdding environment variables is easy too (covered in [Youtube](https://youtu.be/p5_PmnYc5Us) video).\n\n# Other MCPs I‚Äôve been using in Codex\n\n* Web MCP by Bright Data\n* Playwright by Microsoft\n* Supabase for DB management (keep read-only for prod)\n* Basic Memory for unified memory\n\n# What‚Äôs still missing\n\nBesides the missing remote MCP support, the next feature I want is the ability to toggle on/off both individual servers and individual tools (Claude Code is also missing this).\n\n**What about you guys?**  \nWhich MCPs are you running with Codex?

{"postId":"1mn6lof","subreddit":"ChatGPTCoding","title":"Serena MCP goes Codex","selftext":"Wanted to give a quick update to all Serena users: we now added full Codex CLI support!\n\nWith GPT5 available there, codex is now becoming a useful addition to the developer's toolbox. It still lags behind Claude Code in usability IMO, but hopefully it will become better soon, and maybe Serena can help bridge the gap a bit.\n\nStandard MCPs may not work in Codex, since it's not fully MCP compliant, and some massaging of the tool schema needs to be done. That's why Serena was not working there until today, but now did that massaging.\n\n  \nCheck it out if you want to get the most out of Codex!\n\n[https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex)","score":9,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mn6lof/serena_mcp_goes_codex/","permalink":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mn6lof/serena_mcp_goes_codex/","author":"Left-Orange2267","created":1754897570,"numComments":3,"comments":[]}
